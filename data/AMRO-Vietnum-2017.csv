4,5,"Executive Summary In the AMRO annual consultation report on Vietnam (2016), AMRO staff were of the view that despite some growth moderation in 2016, the economy of Vietnam had stayed resilient amid negative shocks. Fiscal policy space, meanwhile, continued to narrow in tandem with rising debt, and the banking sector remained vulnerable. In the staff’s assessment, policy adjustments, including greater flexibility in exchange rate management and the adoption of a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, were in the right direction, and should be continued. In the past year, Vietnam’s economic growth has rebounded strongly with short-term outlook remaining positive, aided by improved global prospects and strengthened domestic demand. The external position has continued to improve, benefiting from strong exports and increased foreign investment, while ongoing consolidation efforts have also led to lower fiscal deficits and debt levels. In light of the recent strong growth momentum, AMRO encourages the authorities to further strengthen their policy focus on financial stability and fiscal sustainability. Ongoing efforts to expedite the non-performing loan resolution and bank recapitalization, including the recent endorsement of a pilot NPL resolution scheme, are welcome. Policy adjustments to tackle medium- to long-term challenges arising from climate and demographic changes, as well as the relative inefficiency of the domestic sector, including state-owned enterprises, are also recommended. Recent Developments and Outlook Economic growth has rebounded in 2017, supported by strong manufacturing exports and strengthened domestic demand, as well as a recovery in agricultural output. Real GDP growth slowed in 2016 to 6.2 percent, as agricultural production was adversely affected by a prolonged drought and increased saltwater intrusion, while mining and quarrying output contracted. The slowdown continued into early 2017 but economic activity has since rebounded strongly, driving real GDP growth to 6.8 percent in 2017. The recent acceleration in growth momentum was driven by increased domestic consumption and investment, and strong exports. Short-term outlook remains positive, with real GDP projected to grow robustly at 6.6 percent in 2018. Despite a pick-up in headline inflation, underlying inflationary pressure remains subdued. Headline CPI averaged 3.5 percent in 2017, up from 2.7 percent a year earlier, driven by higher fuel prices and planned increases in state-administered prices. However, underlying inflationary pressure was more subdued, with core CPI averaging 1.4 percent in 2017, down from 1.8 percent a year earlier. It is projected that headline CPI will increase moderately but remain contained below 4 percent in 2017 and 2018, in line with the government’s target. The external position has continued to improve, benefiting from strong export performance and increased foreign investment. The current account balance is projected to remain in a surplus of about 3.1 percent of GDP in 2017, after a 4.2 percent surplus in 2016. Increased foreign investment inflows, meanwhile, are expected to raise the financial and capital account surplus to about 7.2 percent of GDP in 2017. The Vietnamese dong has been relatively stable recently, following bouts of depreciation in the aftermath of the U.S. election at end-2016 and around the Fed rate hikes in December and March. Against these backdrops, gross international reserves are projected to increase from about USD36.7 billion, as of end- 2016, to around USD51.5 billion at end-2017, which will be sufficient to cover about 2.8 months of imports of goods and services. Credit growth has been buoyant and highly supportive of economic activity. Domestic credit grew at about 19.1 percent, as of November 2017, compared to the target of 18 percent. While bank lending to real estate has slowed, likely in response to a higher regulatory risk",FALSE,normal

5,5,"weight applicable to real estate loans since early 2017, bank lending to construction activities have expanded more rapidly. Growth in broad money has moderated, but liquidity conditions remain ample with interbank rates declining recently. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) lowered its policy rates by 25 basis points in July 2017 to support business activity. A number of institutional changes were initiated recently to speed up the banking sector reform process, including the endorsement of a pilot NPL resolution scheme and a restructuring plan for credit institutions for 2016-2020. Banks, meanwhile, remain fragile with relatively low capital adequacy ratios and still-sizeable NPLs. Fiscal developments in 2017 suggest continued improvements from consolidation efforts. Fiscal position improved in 2016 on the back of an increase in land-based revenue and SOE equitization proceeds. Revenue collection in 2017 exceeded the budget plan, aided by buoyant tax revenue and continued strong land-based revenue. Budget expenditure moderated as current spending normalized from a high base in 2016, while capital spending increased in 2017. As such, the overall fiscal deficit moderated from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2016 to about 3.5 percent in 2017, in line with the authorities’ target. A number of structural measures to enhance tax revenue have been proposed by the Ministry of Finance of Vietnam, as part of the implementation of the recently endorsed Five-Year Fiscal Plan and Medium- Term Public Investment Plan for 2016-2020. On the back of improved fiscal position, public debt is estimated to moderate to about 61.4 percent of GDP in 2017, after peaking at 63.6 percent in 2016. Risks and Vulnerabilities While short-term growth outlook remains positive, downside risks stem from both adverse external shocks and domestic weaknesses. Policy surprises of the Fed and ECB, and the U.S. administration, could lead to greater volatility in asset prices and capital outflows from emerging and frontier markets, including Vietnam. Imposition of protectionist measures by the U.S. and other major trading partners, leading to weaker-than-expected global demand may adversely affect Vietnam via trade channels. On the domestic front, faster credit growth may undermine the progress made in improving the still-fragile banking system by creating new NPLs and weakening banks’ capital buffers. Medium to long-term challenges could arise from climate change, Vietnam’s rapidly aging population, and relative inefficiency of domestic firms, including SOEs. Policy Discussion In light of strong growth performance in 2017, it is recommended that policy focus on financial soundness and fiscal sustainability be strengthened. With credit growth exceeding 18 percent for the last two years and the credit to GDP ratio rising to above 120 percent of GDP - a relatively high level compared to regional peers, a further boost to domestic credit may lead to imprudent lending with adverse effects on financial soundness of the banking system. Recent efforts to expedite NPL resolution and bank recapitalization should be enhanced. AMRO supports the medium-term fiscal consolidation plans and encourages the authorities to continue their revenue enhancing efforts while giving priority to expenditure adjustments which are growth promoting and efficiency enhancing. As Vietnam’s FX reserves in terms of import cover remain low, it is recommended that the SBV continue to build up its reserve buffer over time. Policy adjustments to tackle medium- to long-term challenges arising from climate and demographic changes should be well designed and implemented with concerted efforts from relevant State agencies. Last, but not least, reform measures to enhance long-term growth potential, including SOE reform, are essential.",FALSE,normal

Domestic demand has picked up substantially, supported by stronger final consumption and investment (Figure 1). Exports have rebounded since Q2, lending support to overall growth. As imports also rebounded, driven by FDI-related imports of capital goods, net exports of goods and services made a negative contribution to growth.

7,7,"4. Trade balance has improved recently, led by a strong rebound in export growth. A surge in Information Technology and Communication (ITC) exports, mainly mobile phones, computers, and components in tandem with the release of new Samsung mobile phone models and a strong semiconductor demand globally has lifted export growth significantly since Q2 2017. Continued expansion in exports of clothing and footwear, and a renewed increase in agricultural and seafood exports have also supported overall exports, which grew at about 21.1 percent (year-on-year) in value terms and about 17.6 percent in volume terms in 2017. While the U.S. and E.U. remain the largest importers of Vietnamese goods and products, export growth to regional markets, in particular China and Korea, have been rising rapidly. Growth in imports slowed somewhat in the second half of 2017, but remains elevated, driven mainly by FDI firms’ imports of capital and intermediate goods. As such, imports increased 21.3 percent and 18.2 percent (year-on-year) in value and volume terms, respectively, in 2017. Trade balance has improved since Q2 2017, on the back of rebounding exports.

8,6,"6. The external position has continued to improve, benefiting from strengthened export performance and increased foreign investment. Recently improved trade balance, driven by stronger exports, coupled with resilient overseas remittances, has reversed the current account from a deficit in Q1 2017 into surpluses in subsequent quarters. The current account balance is hence projected to sustain a surplus of about 3.1 percent of GDP in 2017, albeit moderating from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2016. Increased foreign investment inflows, meanwhile, drove the financial and capital account surplus to 7.2 percent of GDP in 2017 (Figure 3). The Vietnamese dong has been relatively stable recently, following bouts of depreciation in the aftermath of the U.S. election in November and around the Fed rate hikes in December and March. Against these backdrops, gross international reserves are projected to increase from about USD36.7 billion, as of end-2016, to around USD51.5 billion at end- 2017, which will be sufficient to cover about 2.8 months of imports of goods and services (Figure 4).",FALSE,normal

In so doing, credit growth was targeted at around 18 percent.

10,5,"Box A. Recent Developments in Banking Sector Reform Ongoing banking sector reform measures have yielded initial positive outcomes. To tackle the NPL problem, a new system of loan classification, which is more in line with internationally-accepted standards, has been adopted since 2014. While this has brought about enhanced transparency and consistency in NPL data reporting, the practice of reporting different NPL data, classified by potentially different sets of criteria, remains. To support banks in resolving the NPL stock accumulated in the aftermath of excessive credit leverage and asset bubbles in 2007-2010, the Vietnam Asset Management Corporation (VAMC) was established in 2013 to acquire and resolve NPLs, and a legal framework facilitating the setup of a debt trading market in Vietnam has also been developed. The VAMC acquired about VND 249,345 billion worth of NPLs as at end-2016, equivalent to about USD11.3 billion, of which about 21.56 percent has been disposed thus far. A recent review of NPL resolution progress in 2011-2016 has identified key bottlenecks to a speedier process, including the VAMC’s still-limited capacity, weak enforcement of creditor’s rights, and regulatory deficiencies to the development of an active debt trading market. On a positive note, several banks have reportedly repurchased their NPLs which were earlier transferred to the VAMC, prior to the maturity date of the special VAMC bonds, and written off those loans from their books. Macro-prudential tools have been increasingly employed to address vulnerability in the financial system. The SBV tightened prudential regulations on banks during 2010-2011 by raising the risk weights for real estate loans and bank lending for securities investment purposes, but relaxed these regulations in 2014, following a period of credit slowdown. Prudential regulations were tightened again with the SBV issuing Circular 06 in May 2016 to increase the risk weight for real estate loans from 150 percent to 200 percent, effective from January 2017, as well as to lower the ratio of short-term funds to medium- to long-term lending from 60 percent to 50 percent by end-2017 and further to 40 percent by end-20185. The SBV has also laid out a timeline for banks to adopt the Basel II standards for the capital adequacy ratio, with the regulatory minimum of 8 percent being applicable to the top (10) banks by January 1, 2019 and to the rest by January 1, 2020. A number of institutional changes have been initiated recently to speed up banking sector reform. The National Assembly endorsed in June 2017 a pilot scheme of NPL resolution (Resolution 42), which seeks to accelerate the pace of NPL collection through the sales of collateral assets, with banks and asset management companies now being able to sell bad debts and their pledged assets at market prices to both legal entities and individuals. Resolution 42 also enhances the rights of creditors to liquidate against mortgage assets and allows a fast track court procedure for cases involving bad debts and their collateral assets. Another important legal document which has been approved recently is the Plan of restructuring credit institutions, with a focus on NPL resolution for 2016-2020. According to the Plan, dividend payout policies on State-Owned-Commercial Banks (SOCBs) may be adjusted to allow those banks to retain State dividends for recapitalization purposes. The Plan also laid out the principle that the public resources, including the state budget, could be used for bank recapitalization purposes, provided that banks’ NPLs had arisen from public investment activities. The Plan also provides a specific timeframe and steps to strengthen the VAMC by 2020. As part of the plan, an amended law to the current Law on Credit Institutions and Foreign Bank Branches has been endorsed by the National Assembly, laying specific steps for restructuring weak banks, including dissolution and bankruptcy. The use of public resources, including the state budget, for the purpose of bank recapitalization, however, has not been specified in the amended Law. Challenges to a speedier process of banking sector reform remain. The progress of NPL resolution at the VAMC has been modest, partly due to VAMC’s relatively limited capital and human resources. Despite a plan to strengthen its capacity by 2020, the VAMC is still facing limitations in terms of capital and human resources. In addition, a number of bottlenecks preventing the development of an active debt trading market remains, including those related to property ownership by foreign investors. In light of fiscal constraints and moral hazard concerns, it is likely that the use of public resources for bank recapitalization purposes will continue to be delayed.",FALSE,normal

Banks’ capital adequacy ratio has trended down across State-owned- commercial banks (SOCBs) and joint stock banks (JSBs) since 2012. SOCBs recently reported their CAR (based on Basel I standards) close to the regulatory minimum level of,FALSE,normal

Banks’ equity capital increased but at a slower pace than the expansion in banks’ assets, driving their capital adequacy ratios lower. Banks continued to make provision for legacy NPLs amid the recent rapid loan growth. SOCBs’ dividend payouts to the State, as their largest and majority shareholder also accounted for more than half of those banks’ net incomes. While the official NPL ratio has been contained at below 3 percent, concerns remain with the unresolved NPLs at the VAMC, which is equivalent to about 3 percent of total loans outstanding (Figure 6). Banks’ profitability indicators have improved since 2016, but are still weak. A number of institutional changes have been initiated recently to step up the banking sector reform process, including the endorsement of a pilot NPL resolution scheme (Resolution 42) and a Restructuring Plan for the Banking Sector in 2016-2020 (Box A).",FALSE,normal

Authorities’ Views: Authorities’ Views: The authorities reiterated their commitment towards accelerating the process of banking sector reform and NPL resolution, which, in their views, would help mitigate risks in the banking sector and improve Vietnam’s economic prospects. In this regard, the VAMC has functioned as a special vehicle to assist banks and other credit institutions not only in resolving their NPLs but also in their restructuring process. Those reform efforts have contributed to containing the official NPL ratio at below 3 percent in 2017. The authorities also committed to improve the legal infrastructure for bank supervision and credit quality control, contributing effectively to NPL resolution and strengthening financial soundness. The authorities also highlighted the exponential growth in the Vietnam’s stock and bond markets in 2017, which ranked Vietnam among the fastest-growing markets in Asia.

Total revenue increased markedly to 24.5 percent of GDP in 2016, from 23.8 percent a year earlier, as losses in tax revenue were more than offset by an increase in non-tax revenue collection. Tax revenue, as a percentage of GDP, declined to below 18 percent in 2016, driven by a lower corporate income tax8, and weaker oil and customs-related revenues. On a positive note, efforts to enhance tax administration efficiency, higher excise and environmental protection tax rates, and resilient domestic consumption, helped offset partly the recent erosion in tax revenue. Most notably, non-tax revenue increased significantly from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2015 to 6.3 percent in 2016, led by higher land-based revenue, and a boost from SOE equitization proceeds. Total expenditure in 2016 stayed largely unchanged from a year earlier, as the pick- up in current expenses9 was offset by a decline in capital spending. Against these backdrops, the overall fiscal deficit moderated to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2016, markedly lower than 6.7 percent seen a year earlier (Figure 7).10",FALSE,normal
12,7,"12. Fiscal developments in 2017 suggest continued improvements from consolidation efforts. Revenue collection in 2017 exceeded the budget plan, aided by buoyant tax revenue and continued strong land-based revenue. As such, fiscal revenue is estimated to increase from 24.5 percent of GDP in 2016 to 24.8 percent in 2017. Fiscal expenditure, meanwhile, is projected to decline from 30.1 percent of GDP in 2016 to about 28.2 percent in 2017, reflecting a decline in current expenditure 11 . Capital spending, meanwhile, increased from 7.3 percent of GDP in 2016 to 7.8 percent in 2017, driven largely by an acceleration in capital investment disbursement in the final quarter of 2017. The overall fiscal deficit is estimated to moderate further to about 3.5 percent of GDP in 2017, in line with the authorities’ target.

According to the authorities, the recent improvement in budget revenue, which exceeds the budget plan target by 8.6 percent amid the adverse impacts of prolonged natural disaster and still-low commodity prices, was driven by a significant increase in revenue collected from land use rights assignment and SOE dividends.

Imposition of protectionist measures in the U.S. and other trading partners leading to weaker-than-expected global demand may adversely affect Vietnam via trade channels. On the domestic front, as credit growth has been over 18 percent for the past two years and the credit to GDP ratio has risen above 120 percent, which is relatively high in comparison with regional emerging and frontier markets (Figure 9), faster credit growth may lead to excessive lending to non-productive/risky sectors, and reverse the progress made in improving the still-fragile banking system by creating new NPLs and weakening banks’ balance sheet.",FALSE,normal

While Vietnam is still benefiting from a relatively young population at present, the low fertility rate and higher life expectancy, implies rapid population aging in the next 20 years. The current “generous” social security system will become unsustainable as fiscal burden will increase exponentially with aging population (Annex 1). An aging population could also have important implications on labor productivity and hence long-term growth potential.

Box B. State-Owned Enterprises in Vietnam State-owned enterprises have had important roles in Vietnam’s economy, albeit with gradually diminishing share. While their share in the economy has declined gradually since the early 1990s, SOEs still account for about one third of total economic output until recently. In terms of fixed assets and long-term investment, SOEs have the largest share, followed by domestic, private firms, and foreign-invested (FDI) firms. SOEs have also contributed the largest share to fiscal revenue (Figure B1).

Figure B2 shows the employment, capital, and revenue size of an average enterprise in Vietnam in 2015, suggesting that SOEs are much larger than both private, domestic firms, and FDI companies (Figure B2). Granular data point to the concentration of power and resources in the largest SOEs. Those SOEs were mainly established after 1994, under the general corporation (GC) model and subsequently further consolidated during 2005-2010, under different categories of economic groups (EG), general corporations (GC), and withholding corporations (WC), having operations in key sectors of the economy, including energy, infrastructure and transportation, post and telecommunication, as well as finance and banking.

Profitability indicators for SOEs have deteriorated recently, amid still-elevated leverage levels. Data on return on assets (ROA) suggest that SOEs’ profitability has declined after 2010 (Figure B4). In addition to the negative impact of the global financial crisis, the asset bubble burst in 2011-2012 hit EGs, GCs, and WCs that had expanded into non-core businesses, including real estate, securities investment, and banking and finance, during 2005-2010.

In this regard, a combination of different policy measures, including the imposition of zero percent interest on USD deposits, had been implemented to curb dollarization.

With the share of young people (below 15 years old) and elderly people (65 years old and above) remaining below 30 percent and 15 percent, respectively, Vietnam is currently benefiting from its demographic dividend/bonus14. However, according to official projections using medium fertility variant, Vietnam’s demographic bonus is expected to end in 2040 when the share of its elderly people starts exceeding 15 percent of total population. According to the UN population database, Vietnam’s population distribution by age group will shift considerably from 2030 onwards, driven by relatively low fertility rates and a rapid rise in life expectancies since the early 2000s (Figure A1.1). In particular, the fertility rate has declined to below the widely accepted replacement rate of 2.1 live births per woman since the early 2000s and is expected to remain low.

21,5,"Vietnam’s evolving social security system consists of three key pillars: (i) social insurance, mainly old-age pension, (ii) health insurance, and (iii) social assistance. The Vietnam Social Security Fund (VSS) has been established since 1995 to take over pension and health insurance funds from various line ministries and State agencies, including the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA), Ministry of Health (MOH), and the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGCL)16. The social assistance pillar has been separately managed under MOLISA, which includes social support provided to certain vulnerable groups in society17. In addition, social assistance related to the labor market has been provided to support redundant labors in term of skill/vocational training and new job seeking (Figure A2). Figure A1.2. Vietnam’s Social Security System Figure A1.3. Budget Expenditure for Social Sector Sources: Bui Tuan Du (2008) and AMRO Staff Compilation Sources: Ministry of Finance, CEIC, and AMRO Staff Calculations The state budget has played a significantly role in funding Vietnam’s social security system. Pension and health insurance funds have been partly financed by the state budget, either in forms of direct employer’s contribution and/or subsidies provided to eligible groups under those schemes; whereas social assistance funds have been mainly financed by the state budget (Figure A1.2). Social spending has been the largest item in budget expenditure, accounting for more than 40 percent of current expenditure on average in the past two decades. Figure A1.3 describes the rising trend in social spending from the state budget, suggesting spending on pension funds, as well as on healthcare subsidies, have increased significantly in recent years. Vietnam’s pension fund structure has been characterized by low coverage and imbalances between benefits and contributions.

Prior to 2016, the contribution rate was 16 percent of employee/beneficiary’s monthly salary with a minimum contribution period of 15 years for retiring; the replacement ratio, meanwhile, was capped at 45 percent of the latest monthly salary after 15 years of contribution, and at 75 percent after 30 years of contribution for men and 25 years of contribution for women. The legal retirement ages have been 60 years for men and 55 years for women, which are relatively low by regional standards. Recognizing that the system is not actuarially sound, the authorities have initiated a number of reform measures to recalibrate the contribution rate and period. In particular, the contribution rate has been raised gradually since 2010 to reach 22 percent from 2016 onwards. Also, in order to enjoy the maximum replacement ratio of 75 percent of the beneficiary’s last drawn salary prior to retirement, the contribution period has been lengthened by 5 years to 35 years for men and",FALSE,normal

Sustainability issues arising from existing structural imbalances in Vietnam’s current pension fund system will become more evident in the context of aging. As mentioned earlier, Vietnam’s population is expected to age rapidly in the next 20 years in tandem with relatively low fertility rates and higher life expectancy (at retirement ages). This will have negative impacts on the current pension fund structure via less contribution from a smaller group of working-age population and higher expenditure on a larger and longer-living group of beneficiaries. While contribution receipts are currently higher than benefit payments, contributing to the continued accumulation in Vietnam’s pension funds18, it is projected that the funds could be depleted within a foreseeable future. According to AMRO staff’s preliminary calculations, spending on pension benefits will continue to expand faster than under the status quo scenario with no population change until 2060, thus leading to a significant increase in the fiscal expenditure amid growth moderation (Box C).

Health insurance membership amounted to 81.9 percent of total population in 2016, up from 28.2 percent in 2005.

Vietnam is currently moderately aging, while remaining young in the region, compared to other aging countries such as Japan and Korea. However, according to the UN projections, Vietnam is expected to face rapid population aging in the next several decades, pushing up old-age dependency ratios until 2060 (Figure C2).

The national health insurance system covers about 82 percent of total population, and about half of its participants are partially or fully funded by the government. The health insurance fund balance in 2017 is projected to turn into a deficit, driven by higher healthcare service charges while the contribution rate is kept unchanged. Rapid aging, in interaction with higher income levels and continued expansion in the healthcare insurance coverage 21 , will imply even greater fiscal burden arising from Vietnam’s heavily-subsidized healthcare insurance system in the future. In this regard, upward adjustments to the contribution rate, and a thorough review of existing benefits, which are not subject to any caps at present, are needed, in order to ensure the sustainability of system and keep the fiscal burden in check going forward.

Boosting Productivity for Sustaining Long-term Growth Prospects Vietnam’s economy has grown rapidly in the last three decades, with an increasing contribution of total factor productivity in recent years. Bolstered by “Ðổi Mới” (which means reform or renovation in Vietnamese) – launched by the government in 1986 to transform Vietnam from a planned economy into a market-oriented one, economic growth accelerated to 8-9 percent in the early 1990s, before declining during the Asian Financial Crisis and hovering around 7 percent in the early 2000s. Although growth has slowed somewhat, it remains relatively robust in comparison with regional peers (Figure A2.1).

Vietnam’s participation in terms of providing inputs for further processing – the forward GVC participation – is relatively low (about 16 percent of gross exports, as at-2011, slightly up from 13 percent in 1995). Vietnam’s particular pattern of GVC participation reflects its recent transition from exports of primary and intermediate products/natural resources to final manufacturing products and the production of these tends to use a relatively large extent of imported inputs. Vietnam’s relatively high backward GVC participation has been consistent with its structural features and policy factors. Vietnam has been endowed with an increasingly large market size, a relatively competitive labor force, and strategically located within the region as well as for inter- regional trade. Vietnam’s favorable trade and investment openness have further contributed to its high level of backward GVC participation. The government’s pro-active participation in preferential trade agreements, as well as its FDI promotion policies have been important “pull” factors attracting foreign investors, in particular MNCs, to establish their presence in Vietnam. As a result, Vietnam’s inward FDI stock stood at 53 percent of GDP in 2015, among the highest levels in ASEAN (Figure E2).",FALSE,normal

Trade has evolved along the GVC backbone, and Vietnam has emerged as an Asian manufacturing powerhouse specializing in assembly functions by primarily foreign firms. This has supported the diversification in the export structure toward higher value-added manufacturing products (Figure E3), with granular trade data indicating the remarkable performance in electronics, textiles and apparel, and agriproducts.

The forward GVC participation index captures the extent to which a given country’s exports are used by firms in partner countries as inputs into their own exports. While both of these measures are expressed as shares of the reference country’s exports, in fact they measure very different forms of engagement. For example, a country that is predominantly assembling products into final goods and subsequently exporting these will have a strong backward participation index but a small forward participation measure. Conversely, a country which predominantly supplies intermediates to an assembler will have a highly developed forward participation indicator but a small backward participation measure. These participation measures therefore give us a metric of engagement in the form of buying from (backward participation) and selling (forward participation) to GVCs or the demand and supply sides of the value chain activity.",FALSE,normal

30,5,"For strengthening the positive spillover of a more efficient FDI sector to the rest of the economy, efforts to expedite SOE reform and private sector development are strongly encouraged. As mentioned earlier, while SOE reform measures have resulted in a decline in the number of SOEs in the past three decades, the SOE sector remains significant in the economy, accounting for a large share of resources while reporting weaker profitability and elevated leverage relative to other sectors in the economy. Recent efforts to step up the SOE equitization in 2016-2020 are hence strongly encouraged and measures to enhance SOE financial transparency and governance are highly recommended. Lack of scale among domestic firms (Figure A2.9) and still-weak linkages between local industries and regional/global value chains have been identified as hurdles to a strong private sector in Vietnam. Promoting the private sector development and strengthening the integration of local supporting industries into regional and global production networks are hence important. Figure A2.9.

In particular, the curriculum of existing government-subsidized vocational training programs could be re-designed/improved to better serve industrial needs.

Quarterly GDP data by expenditure, however, have not been made available. Core CPI inflation data have been released since 2015. CPI data have been rebased to 2014 [previous base year: 2009] with a new CPI basket weight system based on 2014 consumption. Estimated GDP data are released within the final week of each quarter; while revised data are usually released by the end of the following quarter. High-frequency data, such as industrial production and retail sales indices, are not seasonally adjusted and are sometimes in nominal terms only. Historical GDP data using the new base of 2010 have not been made available, making the comparison across time difficult.",FALSE,normal

40,14,"State Budget and Government/ External Debt Quarterly state budget data are available. Data on State-owned- enterprise (SOE) debt are seldom available. The latest Debt Bulletin, which was released in August 2017, reported debt data up to 2015. Certain government borrowings are excluded from the budget data. Public debt cover central government debt, local government debt, and central government guaranteed debt only. SOE debt is excluded from the public debt statistics. Budget data have been based on Vietnamese accounting standards which differ from the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) standards. The newly-revised State Budget Law has made the reporting of budget data more in line with international standards, effective January 2017.

Timeliness refers to how up-to-date the published data are relative to the publication date, (iii) Data quality refers to the accuracy and reliability of the available data given the data methodologies, (iv) Consistency refers to both internal consistency within the data series itself and its horizontal consistency with other data series of either same or different categories, and (v) Other criteria might also apply, if relevant. Examples include, but are not limited to, potential areas of improvement for data adequacy. Source: AMRO Staff Compilation",FALSE,normal
