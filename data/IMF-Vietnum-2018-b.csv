Employing a range of methodologies, the analysis concludes that Vietnam’s medium-term growth potential has increased from 6.2 percent estimated in 2014 to 6.5 percent. Acceleration of reforms that have generated productivity gains in the last decade, including the implementation of agreed free trade agreements, could further boost growth potential.",FALSE,normal
4,5,"1. Vietnam has undergone a major transformation in the last decade. A very productive export-oriented sector financed by FDI has boomed, and in 2017, was responsible for more than two-thirds of Vietnamese exports and a third of the ASEAN’s tech exports. Urbanization has progressed and, concomitantly, employment has continued to shift away from agriculture toward industry and the service sectors, further boosting productivity. The large state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector, which has historically been a barrier to the development of a vibrant private sector, is undergoing equitization and reforms. These measures are helping to limit state involvement in the economy by restricting SOE operations to core areas. Together, these forces have contributed to increase Vietnam’s productivity.",FALSE,normal

The most recent IMF estimates of potential GDP for Vietnam date back to 2014, before the FDI-boom started in earnest.2 Vietnamese authorities do not publish potential output calculations. The empirical foundations for estimating potential output have also evolved following the GFC. This paper uses several approaches—both well-established in the literature and new methodologies—to estimate potential output for Vietnam: (i) a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter; (ii) a multivariate filter; (iii) a multivariate filter augmented by financial frictions; and (iv) a production function approach.

In addition, the filter suffers from the well-known end-point bias, because the last point of the series has an exaggerated impact on the trend. To solve this problem and obtain a more robust estimate at end-2017, we complement the GDP time series with staff GDP projections for the period 2018Q1–2019Q4.

5,5,B. Potential Output Estimates Using A Multivariate Filter,FALSE,sectionheader
5,6,"4. The multivariate filter approach (MVF) estimates potential GDP based on a model that captures relationships between actual and potential GDP, inflation and unemployment (Blagrave and others, 2015). Potential output is derived as the level of output that can be achieved when inflation and unemployment are at their equilibrium levels. Bayesian techniques are used to estimate a system of equations that describe the evolution of the 3 key observable variables (output, core inflation and unemployment) and their relationship with potential output (output gap, Phillip’s curve and Okun’s law). The model’s equations and calibration are detailed in Appendix I. Data on growth and inflation expectations (WEO projections for past vintages) are added, in part to help identify shocks, but mostly to improve the accuracy of estimates at the end of the sample period.",FALSE,normal
5,7,"5. Using the MVF approach, potential growth is estimated at 6.4 percent in 2017 and the output gap at -0.1 percent. While, unlike the HP filter, this methodology relies on economic intuition, there are several shortcomings to applying it to an economy like Vietnam that are worth mentioning. First, as described in Box 1, the relationship between the output gap and inflation is weak. Furthermore, the official unemployment data series exhibits very little variation over the estimation period and unemployment does not seem to respond to aggregate demand shocks. (for example, unemployment was higher in 2004–07—when the output gap was positive—than in 2011–16, after the country was hit by a domestic financial crisis and a negative output gap opened up). This can be explained by the high share of the population employed in the informal, agriculture and the public sectors which are maybe less affected by cyclical conditions.",FALSE,normal

6,7,"This equation is based on the idea that the role of monetary policy is to provide a nominal anchor for inflation, while pursuing other objectives, such as output stabilization and, in the case of Vietnam, exchange rate stability. It describes the tradeoffs that monetary authority faces between its different objectives. In this definition, some firms (α optimally adjust their prices by taking into account expected inflation while the remaining firms (1 - α either don’t adjust their prices or adjust based on the most recently observed rate of inflation. Thus, the behavior of the economy depends critically on the value of α . If it is close to 1, a small monetary policy action (e.g. increase of interest rates) will have a large and rapid effect on inflation and consequently a limited negative impact on growth. The parameter α can also give some insight on the credibility of the monetary policy. The literature shows that economies with weak monetary credibility have low levels of forward- looking expectations as the inflation target is less likely to anchor expectations.1 This feature is found in highly dollarized economies (such as Vietnam historically), worsening tradeoffs between output and inflation stabilization and increasing the cost of carrying out a stabilization process.2 α measures the exchange rate pass-through to core inflation while α measures the effect of the output gap, that is the excess/slack of aggregate demand, on inflation. To analyze the effect of these variables on Vietnam’s inflation, we conduct a regression analysis to determine the parameters of the reduced-form Phillip’s curve. The coefficients on lagged and expected inflation are constrained so that they sum to one, to follow the definition given by equation (i). Finally, we use core inflation, which excludes raw food, energy and administered prices. The latter have been the main contributors to headline inflation in recent years, as the Vietnamese authorities have raised healthcare and education fees to increase cost recovery. Since the variation of these prices depends on fiscal and social policies rather than monetary policy, we exclude these prices from our analysis.",FALSE,normal

The negative sign of the output gap coefficient is counter-intuitive, pointing to the data issues discussed earlier. The coefficient on expected inflation is greater than for 2000–17, indicating that the expectations have become more forward-looking. It also implies that the effects of the exchange rate and output gap on inflation have become less persistent while the exchange rate pass-through effect has declined further, in line with the strong stability of the exchange rate during this period. These results may also reflect to some extent credibility gains from the central bank after a period of successful macro-stabilization, also evident in the e observed de-dollarization underway in Vietnam.",FALSE,normal

7,7,"6. This methodology deviates from the MFV in that it focuses on sustainable output levels, rather than potential output (Berger et al., 2015). The sustainable output level is the level of GDP that an economy can sustainably produce over the medium-term in the absence of imbalances. GDP can be at potential but may not be sustainable in the event of a credit boom that temporarily lifts output growth but affects inflation with a lag. This methodology maybe particularly relevant for Vietnam, which has experienced several years of sustained high credit growth.

Determining elasticities. Due to the unavailability of Vietnam-specific values, the output elasticity with respect to labor, or income share of labor, is determined on the basis of regional estimates. To the extent that Vietnam is integrated into the Asian value chain because of the growing FDI flows from the region, one can expect Vietnam’s output elasticity trends to follow that of its predecessors in the value chain. ASEAN-4 countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia), China (and India) show similar trends of declining income share of labor associated with rising per capita incomes. These countries also exhibit steady increases in their capital intensity (i.e. capital to labor ratio), which was identified as a main factor in the decline of labor income shares in emerging markets.5 By using the approximated linear relationship between the capital to labor ratio and the income share of labor, we estimate Vietnam’s income share of labor.",FALSE,normal

The GFC and domestic financial turmoil in 2008 and 2011 led to a slowdown of TFP growth. Since 2013, TFP has recovered and grew at an average of 1.7 percent per year. 7 Regression analysis shows that the main drivers of TFP growth have been increasing FDI inflows, the declining share of employment in agriculture, declining credit to SOEs and increasing domestic private investment.",FALSE,normal

We project a moderate improvement in average TFP growth due to the continued shift of labor away from agriculture and towards the more productive manufacturing sector, and increased FDI inflows and private sector participation. Regressions analysis supports a wide range of average TFP growth between 1.7 to 2.5 percent. An average TFP growth over 2 percent per year is unlikely to materialize in the current global and regional context, in which most countries have seen a worsening of productivity growth in the aftermath of the GFC and given the impact of aging on TFP growth.9 Hence, assuming continuity in the pace of structural reforms and improved fundamentals that have produced TFP growth in the recent past, we assume TFP to grow by an average 1.8 percent, similar to the 2014–17 average.",FALSE,normal

19,5,"4. To assess whether credit growth has been excessive, the analysis examines two early warning indicators (EWI) for credit widely used in the literature. The first EWI is the deviation of credit-to-GDP ratios from its HP filter trend (the credit gap, hereafter), where the HP filter trend provides an estimation of the long-term trend of financial deepening. The credit gap is considered the most informative EWI for capturing excessively rapid increases (or decreases) in credit volume in the literature (e.g., Drehmann and Tsatsaronis 2014). Given its high predictive powers for crises, it is often recommended as a trigger for implementing or tightening macroprudential policies. The second EWI is the year-on-year percentage point changes in credit-to-GDP ratios (the credit growth gap, hereafter). While the credit growth gap is a less common EWI than the credit gap in the literature, the analysis by Gersl and Jasova (2018) empirically shows that the credit growth gap is more informative in predicting financial crises in emerging economies than the credit gap.",FALSE,normal
19,6,"5. The EWIs in Vietnam indicate that credit has been growing faster than financial deepening. The credit gap was positive but still less than 10 percent in 2017, as compared to the more than 20 percent gap during the 2011 crisis (text Figure). The credit growth gap reached almost the same level as the one during the 2011 crisis in the mid-2016 but declined somewhat in 2017 due to both the higher nominal GDP growth and the lower credit growth. It is worth noting, however, that the aggregate credit data cannot capture risks associated with sectoral credit growth, such as very high credit growth rates in consumer loans in recent years. Also, there may be risks from directed credit, namely commercial banks being asked by the government to lend to preferred sectors at lower interest rates.",FALSE,normal
19,7,"6. Under current projections for the economic outlook, the risk to financial stability could be contained if overall credit growth is tightened further. The government’s credit growth target for 2018 is set at 17 percent. Under the baseline scenario of nominal GDP growth of around 10.5 percent in 2018 and 2019, the credit gap and the credit growth gap will increase but still be around 6–7 percent and 7–9 percentage points in 2019. However, if credit growth were to accelerate to 20 percent in 2018 and 2019, the credit gap and the credit growth gap would swiftly rise to",FALSE,normal

The figure indicates that the credit-to-GDP ratios in Vietnam have grown at a faster pace than estimated by their per capita GDP. The ratios were within the 1.5-SD band after the correction during the 2011 crisis, but they are now outside the 1.5-SD band again reflecting the recent rapid credit growth. The same benchmarking exercise in selected countries (text Figure) shows large positive deviations from benchmark levels historically led to banking crises followed by sharp corrections in credit volumes. Past experiences in other countries also suggests that while large and positive deviations of credit-to-GDP ratios from 2 The data for credit-to-GDP ratios are taken from the BIS database of credit gaps (https://www.bis.org/statistics/c_gaps.htm).

SOE privatization and reforms will not only support the high economic growth but also directly contribute to the performance of listed SOEs, which still dominate stock markets in Vietnam.5 Stock market corrections could affect the real economy through declines in IPOs, a slowdown in SOE equitization, and the deterioration in bank and corporate balance sheets, but more granular data are needed for further assessment of the impact through this channel.",FALSE,normal

23,6,"12. House price misalignment is assessed by the following two approaches. First, substantial changes in the Price-to-Rent ratios (house prices divided by rent indexes) can be interpreted as deviations from economic fundamentals due to, for instance, excessive and risky lending by banks to this sector. In this approach, rent represents the fundamental value of housing, and theoretically the ratios should be stationary (Poterba 1984). The second approach is a regression-based assessment (e.g., IMF 2004). In this approach, house price misalignment is estimated by the following conventional model for house price valuation:",FALSE,normal
23,7,", , , , , Here, the affordability ( , ) is defined as house prices divided by per capita GDP, and represents a long-term relation between house prices and real economy. The estimation is conducted by (unbalanced) cross-country panel data for Asian emerging economies, namely Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, China and Vietnam. Then, the deviations from the fitted values are interpreted as house price misalignment.6",FALSE,normal

Since 2015, the residential property price index in HCMC has continued to increase (text Figure). The price-to-rent ratios, however, have not significantly increased as in the previous crisis period in 2011, and they are now converging to the 2015 level due to the increase in rent, suggesting that the increase in house prices are justified by economic fundamentals (text Figures). Economic fundamentals which can justify the recent increase in property prices include: (1) the strong income growth of a growing middle class, and (2) a steady rate of urbanization supporting the demand for housing in a city area.

This result suggests that the recent developments in property prices in Vietnam are in line with economic fundamentals, which is consistent with the analysis by price-to-rent ratios. Based on our forecast for per capita income and working age population in Vietnam, the model would suggest that real house prices will be almost flat or increase only moderately for the next several years as houses become more affordable in Vietnam.",FALSE,normal
24,6,"15. House price misalignments based on regression analysis should be interpreted with caution in the case of Vietnam. For Asian countries other than Vietnam, the model can account for most of the variation in house prices, suggesting that income growth and demographic variables capture the behavior of housing prices well (text Figure). However, given the large deviations of the actual historical values from fitted values in Vietnam, the model does not seem to have strong predictive powers in Vietnam (text Figure in paragraph 14). Since the large deviations from fitted values may be explained by the low quality of real estate data in Vietnam, more reliable data for house prices are necessary for a more precise and comprehensive assessment.",FALSE,normal

25,16,"16. Overall, asset price and credit growth appear to be stronger than warranted by fundamentals. In particular, the central bank’s credit growth target should be decreased to avoid excessive risk taking by banks, and raising the target would not be warranted. Continued SOE and other growth-supporting reforms would help better align the rapid rise in stock market valuations with fundamentals. Finally, the SBV should develop a macroprudential policy framework including loan-to-value (LTV) and debt service-to-income (DSTI) requirements to deal with future possibilities of excessive exuberance in the real estate market.",FALSE,normal

The authorities have so far adhered to the rule, but recent high deficits have brought PPG close to the limit. This note analyzes the appropriateness of the current debt ceiling, while taking into account fiscal risks, rising age-related spending costs and other contingent liabilities.

The authorities are committed to adhering to their debt rule; PPG debt has so far remained below the statutory limit in recent years (Figure 1).

While ad-hoc measures and privatization receipts are likely to keep debt below 65 percent in the near- to medium-term, in the absence of further consolidation efforts, or in the case of adverse shocks, PPG debt could breach the debt limit within a few years.

28,6,"4. A statutory limit on PPG debt is appropriate for Vietnam because it can help ensure debt sustainability and trigger a fiscal response that limits repeated fiscal slippages, while providing an anchor for medium-term fiscal planning. As of 2015, about 70 countries worldwide had a fiscal framework with an explicit cap on public debt. Debt rules are generally set in gross rather than net terms, as in Vietnam, because it is difficult to know a priori which government assets are truly liquid, particularly in times of financial stress. Also, the concept of net debt is less transparent than gross debt and more difficult to communicate to the public.",FALSE,normal
28,7,5. The appropriate level of the debt target for Vietnam is one that is realistically calibrated to be aligned with Vietnam’s medium-term objectives. Calibration of the debt ceiling is done in three steps.,FALSE,normal
28,8,"Step 1: setting a maximum debt limit. The maximum debt limit is the level beyond which a debt distress episode is likely to occur with heightened probability (for example, default, restructuring, or large increases in sovereign spreads). In this exercise, the maximum debt limit for Vietnam is set to 80 percent of GDP, similar to the limit for emerging economies in the MAC DSA (70 percent of GDP), plus 10 percent to account for public guarantees that enter the gross debt level to 100 percent, but are unlikely to be fully drawn.5 In fact, guarantees have rarely been drawn in Vietnam in the past (although debt restructuring was aided in alternative ways). This is why the analysis builds in an additional 10 percent buffer on top of the 70 percent of GDP maximum debt limit. As fiscal consolidation continues and the level of outstanding guarantees is reduced, a lower level of maximum debt limit could be considered in time. Similarly, as age related costs rise in the longer- term, a lower debt limit will be necessary to make room for future aging-related spending needs. The stochastic model calibrates a debt anchor based on short- to medium-term risk, therefore higher long-term costs cannot be modeled in the standard framework. To allow for the longer-term aging costs within this framework, the maximum debt limit should be set at a lower level by subtracting the estimated 8 percent of GDP age-related spending from the maximum debt limit (reducing it to",FALSE,normal

This requires estimating the joint distribution of GDP growth, the interest rates on government debt (both foreign and domestic), and the exchange rate. In the baseline, past economic performance is used for the forecast (past means and variances). Earlier research on stochastic simulations of debt trajectories includes IMF (2003), Garcia and Rigobon (2004), and Celasun et al. (2007).",FALSE,normal
29,6,"Step 3: estimating the debt anchor in the baseline scenario. The third step identifies the debt anchor (i.e., the debt ceiling) accounting for macroeconomic shocks. The debt anchor is defined as that level of debt which will remain below the maximum debt limit (i.e. 80 percent of GDP for Vietnam; see Step 1) over the medium term with high probability, despite the potential for negative macroeconomic shocks identified in step two. A fan chart of Vietnam’s public debt- to-GDP ratio is generated from stochastic simulations (Figure 2), accounting for macroeconomic shocks discussed under Step 2.6 The initial year chosen for the simulations is 2017. The simulation is based on historical data for Vietnam, and suggests that a debt anchor of 66.5 percent could be sufficient to ensure that debt stays below the maximum debt limit of 80 percent with 90 percent certainty.",FALSE,normal

30,7,"7. While a debt rule provides a useful anchor for medium term fiscal policy, the debt rule should be augmented to provide operational guidance to fiscal policy in the short term. Operational rules target aggregates that the authorities have more direct control over, such as public expenditure, revenue and the budget balance. While not recognized officially as fiscal rules, Vietnam’s budget plan is subject to several thresholds, making the current fiscal framework in Vietnam potentially over-committed. Thresholds and floors determine the current balance, the overall balance, tax revenue, total spending (upper limit), capital spending (lower threshold), and others, some of which are specified annually, some as a medium-term perspective. In the current system, if one target underperforms, others will. For example, if public revenue underperforms, spending will have to be cut to reach the overall balance target, often done via capital spending, therefore missing the capital spending target. If the desired capital spending target is met, the budget balance target will not be reached. While these targets provide clear guidance for policy makers, they limit flexibility to respond to crises. The number of rules and targets also complicates communication, particularly if several targets are missed to compensate for one missed target. It would be preferable to replace these multiple targets with one or two shorter-term operational rules that is under the direct control of the government and has a close and predictable link to debt dynamics. In this paper, we suggest a ceiling on the nominal growth rate of expenditure rule (an expenditure rule).

34,4,"Appendix I – Principles of Fiscal Rules The system of fiscal rules should be anchored by a debt objective to preserve fiscal sustainability. The debt anchor is directly linked to fiscal sustainability, the main objective of the fiscal framework. The anchor should thereby inform medium-term expectations about fiscal policy, and is not meant to provide clear short-term guidance to policymakers. Public debt is inherently persistent and affected by many other developments besides changes in the overall budget balance. A well-anchored fiscal framework thus aims at bringing predicted public debt to or below the ceiling over the longer run. Short-term guidance, instead, should be given on the basis of operational rules, which concern variables under the direct control of governments and which serve to communicate the fiscal stance to the public, while having a close and predictable link to debt dynamics.",FALSE,normal
34,5,"The fiscal framework should consist of a small set of rules. A debt rule serving as fiscal anchor should be combined with one or a few rules on operational variables under policymakers’ control, such as an expenditure growth limit or the budget balance. Parsimonious frameworks are more easily monitored and communicated to the public, building the government’s credibility. As such, the current fiscal framework in Vietnam might be over-committed and complicates communication, particularly if several targets are missed to compensate for one missed target. At the same time, it is not clear whether the number of operational rules should be limited to one.",FALSE,normal
34,6,"Fiscal policy has numerous objectives, which are not as clearly defined as those of monetary policy (Leeper, 2015). Therefore, having one operational rule per key objective may be preferable to overloading a single rule with multiple tasks. For instance, a trade-off may emerge between the two objectives of ensuring long-term sustainability and protecting capital expenditure. In this case, two rules could be considered to combine a ceiling on total (current plus capital) expenditure, and current expenditure (see IMF 2018b), effectively adding one rule to the above described framework. IMF (2018b) provides some guidance on how to select the most appropriate fiscal rules.",FALSE,normal
