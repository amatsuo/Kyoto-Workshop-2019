2,3,"IMF Executive Board Concludes 2019 Article IV Consultation with Indonesia On July 3, 2019, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Indonesia. The Indonesian economy performed well in 2018, despite external headwinds, including capital flow reversals. Growth stabilized at above 5 percent, as robust domestic demand offset a decline in net exports. The recovery of credit growth supported economic activity. Inflation eased to around 3 percent, the lower half of the official target band (3.5±1percent), as food price increases were subdued, electricity and some fuel prices were frozen, and macroeconomic policies were tightened. Core inflation is stable at 3 percent. The current account deficit widened to 2.98 percent of GDP in 2018 (1.6 percent in 2017), mainly due to lower commodity exports and higher infrastructure-related imports. The economic outlook is positive. Real GDP growth is projected to remain stable at 5.2 percent in 2019 and 2020, and rise to the level of potential (5.3 percent) over the medium term, underpinned by robust domestic demand. Strong bank balance sheets and continued economic growth would sustain credit growth at about 12 percent. Inflation is projected to remain within the target band. The current account deficit would continue its gradual decline to 2.6 percent of GDP over the medium term. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain constant at 1.8 percent of GDP. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. The main risks are external and include rising trade tensions, sharp tightening of global financial conditions, weaker-than-expected growth in China, and large swings in commodity prices, especially higher oil prices that would translate into higher current account deficit. On the upside, the start of the Administration’s second term could lead to intensified reform efforts, which would boost confidence, investment, and growth.",TRUE,normal

3,3,"Executive Board Assessment2 Executive Directors commended the authorities’ policy response in the face of strong external headwinds in 2018, which supported positive economic performance. While noting the favorable economic outlook, Directors encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant against risks, including from capital flow reversals, considering Indonesia’s reliance on external financing. They considered that achieving higher potential growth requires a comprehensive structural reform package, including higher domestic revenue mobilization and financial deepening, which will reduce vulnerabilities and facilitate complementary reforms in human capital, infrastructure, and labor and products markets.",TRUE,normal
3,4,"Directors welcomed the appropriate focus of the near-term policy mix on protecting macroeconomic and financial stability, safeguarding buffers, and addressing vulnerabilities. They supported maintaining a neutral fiscal stance and closely assessing macroprudential policies to ensure financial system stability. With inflation within the target band, Directors saw scope for cautious relaxation of the monetary policy stance, unless significant capital account pressures reemerge. They encouraged allowing the exchange rate to continue moving in line with market forces, with FX intervention limited to preventing disorderly market conditions.",TRUE,normal
3,5,"Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts to protect fiscal buffers, including with the elimination of the primary deficit in 2018, and improve the quality of spending by rebalancing expenditure toward infrastructure, education, health, and social safety nets. However, Directors noted that government revenues remain below peer countries and insufficient to finance the authorities’ development goals. In this context, they highlighted the critical need to implement a medium-term revenue strategy, which combines well-sequenced and prioritized tax policy and administration reforms, to finance priority spending and structural reforms, and lessen reliance on external financing. Directors also called for monitoring risks and contingent liabilities arising from state-owned enterprises and public-private partnerships.",TRUE,normal
3,6,"Directors commended efforts to improve infrastructure, streamline regulations and reform the education and health sectors, which have contributed to improvements in the economic environment. They encouraged the authorities to expand these efforts and to address remaining structural impediments to higher growth, including by strengthening governance and the business environment. Priority actions also include improving human capital, increasing female labor participation, easing restrictions to foreign direct investment, and streamlining labor and product market regulations.",TRUE,normal

Growth stabilized above 5 percent and inflation eased to around 3 percent. A surge in imports and weak export growth contributed to a higher current account deficit. Growth is projected to remain stable over the medium term. Inflation is expected to remain within the target band and the current account deficit is expected to narrow gradually on lower imports. Risks are tilted to the downside and are mainly external. Reliance on portfolio inflows to finance the twin deficits leaves Indonesia vulnerable to capital flow reversals. President Joko Widodo has been re-elected for a second term and has committed to push ahead with economic reforms.

9,5,"1. The Indonesian economy performed well in 2018, despite external headwinds. Tighter global financial conditions in 2018 resulted in episodes of exchange rate pressures and capital outflows from Indonesia, which was relatively hard hit compared to other emerging markets in Asia (Figure 1). External pressures have moderated since October 2018 and inflows have resumed, although considerable volatility remains, including from heightened trade tensions. Faced with external headwinds, policy flexibility supported a positive macroeconomic performance in 2018— growth stabilized at above 5 percent and inflation was moderate at around 3 percent.",FALSE,normal
9,6,"2. However, Indonesia still confronts vulnerabilities and challenges. Major vulnerabilities stem from low tax revenues and shallow financial markets, which have led to heavy reliance on volatile portfolio inflows to finance the twin budget and current account deficits. Nonresident investors hold about 40 percent of rupiah-denominated government bonds and a third of corporate debt financing, leaving the country vulnerable to capital flow reversals. Furthermore, labor and product market rigidities have constrained growth, which needs to be boosted to harness the young and growing labor force.",FALSE,normal
9,7,"3. Discussions focused on post-election reform priorities to boost inclusive growth. With President Joko Widodo re-election, the start of his second term will provide a window of opportunity to push ahead with structural reforms. In addition to macrofinancial policies to protect stability, the consultation focused on structural reforms to address vulnerabilities and boost growth, centering on two pillars: (i) operationalizing a medium-term revenue strategy that would raise resources to finance priority spending; and (ii) accelerating financial deepening to promote stable financing. These reforms would lessen Indonesia’s reliance on volatile capital inflows and facilitate complementary reforms in the labor and product markets, in particular human capital development, infrastructure enhancement, and improvement of the business environment, which are essential to lift potential growth.",FALSE,normal
9,8,"4. The authorities’ policies were appropriate given the external pressures in 2018. Considering downside risks to the outlook, the small estimated output gap, the economy’s vulnerabilities, and external shocks to the current and financial accounts, the policy strategy that prioritized macroeconomic and financial stability in the presence of unexpected external pressures in 2018 was appropriate. Tightened fiscal and monetary policy helped reduce the financing needs of the public sector and protected investor confidence. The authorities are taking steps to implement the 2017 FSAP recommendations (Table 11). However, progress in implementing a medium-term revenue strategy to raise resources has been slow, as the authorities have focused only on the tax administration angle of the strategy.",FALSE,normal

Gross fixed investment, which grew at 6.7 percent, was a driver of domestic demand. Solid consumer confidence supported private consumption, which grew by 5.1 percent.

The credit gap has been reduced to −1.2 percent of GDP in 2018:Q4.

10,9,"8. The current account deficit (CAD) widened to 3 percent of GDP in 2018 (1.6 percent in 2017), mainly due to lower commodity exports and higher infrastructure-related imports. Tighter global financial conditions during Q2/Q3 2018 led to a sharp decline in net portfolio and FDI flows, which combined fell by 1.6 percent of GDP relative to 2017.1 Overall, the balance of payments (BoP) reached a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP, with the current account deficit more than offsetting the financial account surplus.

Important steps have been taken to improve tax administration—such as risk-based audits, lifting bank secrecy, and ongoing development of IT system, which supported the positive revenue performance in 2018. As electricity and some fuel prices were frozen, energy subsidies increased (50 percent, y/y)—although partially offset by restraints of other expenditures (capital expenditure in particular). Indonesia’s general government revenue to GDP ratio is below 15 percent, trailing revenue collection in most EMs, and constraining development and growth-enhancing spending.

30,4,"Box 3. Developing the Money Market Deep money markets are critical for liquidity management in the financial system and represent the cornerstone for the development of other financial markets. Well-functioning money markets provide price references for the short-end of the yield curve and for the creation of products such as floating-rate bonds and hedging tools, which facilitate the development of capital markets. The authorities have made considerable efforts to advance the development of money markets. In 2018, they launched the National Strategy on Financial Market Development (2018−2024) to highlight financial deepening as one of the policy priorities. BI issued several regulations and guidelines in recent years, including on negotiable certificate of deposits for banks, commercial papers for nonbank corporations, and interest rate derivatives for both, to help them diversify funding sources and facilitate risk sharing and longer-term financing. In August 2018, BI started publishing a transaction-based Indonesia Overnight Index Average (IndONIA) to replace the quotation-based overnight JIBOR as the overnight money market benchmark rate. Also, BI has organized seminars and workshops to promote a wider use of repo and FX transactions. The authorities have increased the frequency of T-Bills issuances to enhance liquidity and price formation at the short-end of the yield curve. Thanks to these efforts, the daily average volume of money market instruments grew strongly in recent years (about 12.3 percent, y/y). However, the daily average volume and outstanding balance of the unsecured interbank market were still small at Rp 16.6 trillion and Rp 46.8 trillion, about 0.1 and 0.3 percent of GDP, respectively in December 2018. The outstanding interbank repos amounted to only about Rp 11.7 trillion, even smaller than the unsecured transaction. Several factors constrain the development of money markets, particularly repo transactions. They include structural excess liquidity in the banking system (though some small non-systemic banks are vulnerable to liquidity shocks), market segmentation, limited capacity and lack of incentives of smaller banks, and tax constraints on repos. Excess liquidity reduces banks’ need to engage in interbank market transactions, thereby undermining market development. Smaller banks prefer funding their needs on the unsecured interbank market because of complexity to maintain collaterals for repo transactions. The lack of tax rate synchronization among instruments has impeded the development of the money market: for example, unequal tax treatment between short-term (20 percent) and long-term financial instrument (15 percent) and between banks’ repo transactions (non-final tax) and those on non-banks (final tax). Pursuing ongoing efforts through a number of actions will help further improve Indonesia’s money market. First, to strengthen the short-end of the yield curve, BI should expand the tenor of the IndONIA to longer tenors, the MOF should continue to gradually increase the stock of T-bills and keep reducing the overlap between T-bills and BI securities on the same maturities. Second, BI should extend averaging to cover all primary reserve requirements, which would allow banks to improve liquidity management. Third, efforts to enhance the use of the global master repurchase agreement (GMRA) should continue to help smaller banks increase their participation in the interbank repo transactions. Fourth, the MOF should review tax treatments on financial instruments and repo transactions. Fifth, the bankruptcy law needs to be amended, so that close-out netting can happen to mitigate counterparty credit risk.",FALSE,normal

In addition to domestic revenue mobilization and financial deepening, Indonesia needs labor and product market reforms to create quality jobs for its young and growing labor force, and reap the demographic dividend. Fund research suggests through an illustrative scenario that raising revenue of 3 percent of GDP to expand public spending in infrastructure, education, and health, along with structural reforms to the labor and product markets (e.g., reduction of trade and FDI restrictions and lowering of state control in the economy) would increase potential growth by 1 percentage point over the medium-term.1 The authorities have made progress on structural reforms in recent years. They have advanced infrastructure development, a government priority in recent years, including by increasing public capital spending by 1 percent of GDP between 2014 and 2017 and improving the institutional framework by creating the Committee for Acceleration of Priority Infrastructure Delivery (KPPIP). There were also efforts to improve the business environment by streamlining regulations. A transparent minimum wage formula was adopted, the land acquisition process was simplified, and the FDI regime was partially liberalized. These efforts have led to a notable rise in Indonesia’s Doing Business ranking, from the 106th in 2016 to the 73rd in 2019. Notwithstanding these efforts, pursuing labor and product market reforms would remove important impediments to growth.

The authorities have held several discussions with the Parliament on the amendment of relevant laws. A draft bill amending the BI Law is included in the 2015-19 National Legislation Program. The Program also includes an initiative to amend the OJK Law. Amend the Insurance Law to specify policyholder protection as principal objective of",FALSE,normal

54,9,"The authorities have initiated discussions regarding this issue with related parties, will include it in the amendment of the Insurance Law and propose this issue to the Parliament. Strengthen legal protection of supervisors and officials of all agencies involved in financial oversight and crisis management in line with global standards. The authorities have incorporated this issue in the discussion material with the Parliament. OJK will also put the legal protection on cases related to supervisory duties in the draft amendment of OJK Law. Systemic risk monitoring and prudential policy Introduce a foreign currency liquidity coverage ratio. OJK has been imposing LCR based on significant currencies as a monitoring tool, compliant with the Basel LCR standards, but does not have a plan to introduce it as a regulatory requirement. Strengthen BI’s capacity for systemic risk analysis and macroprudential stress tests, and OJK’s capacity for regulatory stress tests; OJK should do bottom-up stress tests for D- SIBs regularly. OJK has implemented the annual bottom-up stress tests for D-SIBs and other large banks. BI and OJK have established a framework for a joint stress test and data sharing. The authorities continue to improve their stress test framework, supported by the IMF technical assistance. Financial sector oversight Reduce OJK’s silo structure, including by revising the OJK Law to remove the responsibilities of individual Commissioners for the supervision of specific sectors. To advance on the recommendation to reduce silos in financial oversight, which ultimately requires changes to the OJK Law, OJK has enhanced the internal coordination: Chief executives of all sectors meet and coordinate through Committee Meetings. Strengthen the banking supervisory approach and continue enhancing supervisory practices for FCs. OJK has put integrated supervision of financial conglomerate (FC) and the coordination among chief executives as primary agendas. As the majority of FCs is led by banks, bank supervisors play a leading role in the supervision of FCs. However, OJK reversed the establishment of the Integrated Supervisory and Regulatory Department which brought internal coordination for the conglomerate supervision directly under the authority of the Chairman. Further strengthen the enforcement of credit and risk management regulations. OJK has set up Risk Management Working Group and put the enforcement of credit and risk management regulations as priority for the related departments. Revise the insurance supervisory framework (three strikes-approach) to allow prompt actions. OJK has issued a regulation concerning the imposition of administrative sanctions in the form of revocation of business license without prior imposition of other administrative sanctions in cases where there is a drastic deterioration of financial conditions, shareholders are not cooperative, and there is no way of solving the problems that endanger the interests of policyholders, the insured, or the participants. Governance of financial conglomerates (FCs) Strengthen corporate governance practices within the financial system, including the BoC’s oversight roles and responsibilities. OJK has issued a regulation that set the general principle of governance to be adopted by FCs, specifically roles of the BoC of the lead entity of FCs. Introduce legal provisions for licensed non-operating financial holding companies. OJK is working together with MoF to achieve the broadening of authority toward holding companies. New articles have been proposed to be incorporated into the amendment of OJK law, stipulating OJK’s authority to license and oversee non- operating financial holding companies. Crisis management and resolution, and safety nets Revise the PPKSK Law to clarify the role of the KSSK as solely a coordination body; limit the involvement of the President to approving public funding. Given the lengthy protocols entailed and potential political interests involved in an amendment of the Law, the authorities are carefully evaluating the best option to achieve the desired outcomes. Adjust the emergency liquidity assistance framework to ensure it is effective. The current ELA framework is in accordance with the legal basis governed under the PPKSK Law, any proposed amendment to the current framework should be based on the underlying legal basis. The authorities are carefully evaluating the best option to achieve the desired outcomes. Amend the relevant laws to ensure that resolution powers can be exercised over FCs. The authorities have initiated discussions regarding this issue and LPS is considering this issue in the enhancement of resolution. Develop resolution options and implementation guidelines for banks, and resolvability assessment and resolution planning frameworks for D-SIBs. LPS, OJK, and BI have established a working group on resolution plan and resolvability assessment. LPS is developing a comprehensive resolution framework that sets out guidance on the selection and implementation of resolution options , supported by the IMF technical assistance Financial integrity Integrate key ML/TF risks in the priorities and operations of relevant agencies. The National Committee for the Prevention and Eradication of Money Laundering has established a national AML/CFT strategy which covers the priorities and operations of related authorities. Finalize and implement risk-based AML/CFT supervisory tools. BI and OJK have published regulations related to risk-based AML/CFT supervisory tools, supported by the IMF technical assistance. Based on Indonesia’s Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), published in September 2018 by the Asia Pacific Group, OJK is assessed as adequate in its regulation and implementation based on AML/CFT international standards. Financial deepening and inclusion Develop an integrated roadmap for promoting financial deepening and inclusion. The authorities have published the 2018-2024 National Strategy for Financial Market Development in 2018. Enhance bond yield curve by consolidating debt issuance and improving secondary markets.

Capital inflows decline due to weaker investor appetite for emerging market (EM) assets, creating funding pressures for the current account (CA) deficit. Tighter external financial conditions put pressure on the balance sheets of the public, financial, and corporate sectors. Bank funding becomes constrained, leading to a crunch in domestic credit growth and higher domestic borrowing costs. Rollover risks rise for the public, financial, and corporate sectors, and the balance sheet of households (including property) weaken. Economic growth falls, reinforced by asset price corrections and lower confidence. Assuming prices are not controlled, the rupiah depreciates and imports decline, reducing the CA deficit. Maintain exchange rate flexibility and market-determined bond yields. Preserve a sound fiscal position, while allowing automatic stabilizers to work. Tighten monetary policy and support banks facing funding pressures to preserve financial stability and avoid negative feedback loops with capital outflows. Closely monitor corporate sector vulnerabilities. Maintain vigilance on exchange rate pass-through to inflation. Access contingent external financing if needed. Weaker-than-expected global growth and China slowdown. The global growth slowdown could be synchronized as weakening outlooks in the U.S., Europe and China feed off each other and impact on earnings, asset prices and credit performance. In China, in the short term, intensification of trade tensions and/or a housing market downturn prompt a slowdown, which is not fully offset by policy easing.

Corporate profits would decline from weak commodity related activities. Maintain exchange rate flexibility to help reduce the current account deficit and limit FX reserve losses.

The share of Indonesia’s exports that—roughly speaking—crosses two borders has increased from 28 percent in 1995 to 44 percent in 2011, before declining somewhat since then. While the trend in overall GVC participation is similar for many other countries in the region, the composition is not. For Indonesia, forward GVC participation (the exported domestic value added that is reexported by the importer) has recently been more than twice the size of backward participation (imported foreign value added that is re-exported). This suggests that Indonesia is relatively higher up in global value chains and particularly vulnerable to spillovers from further downstream.2",FALSE,normal

58,4,"3. Nominal tariffs may affect economic outcomes through various channels, including beyond the country and sector directly targeted. The underlying empirical analysis relies on four measures that capture possible spillovers from tariffs, either vertically up and down the value chain, or horizontally through trade diversion. Specifically, upstream and downstream tariffs capture the average cumulative tariffs applied respectively to the imported intermediate inputs of the sector or its output.3 The domestic protection tariff captures the average tariff (import-weighted) imposed on imports that compete with the domestic sector’s output. Finally, the diversion tariff captures the weighted average tariff that partner countries impose on all other suppliers except the country- sector in question.",FALSE,normal
58,5,"4. Indonesia’s constructed tariff measures compare favorably to peers but hide substantial sectoral heterogeneity. The moderate reliance on imported intermediate inputs, combined with comparatively lower tariffs imposed on Indonesian imports and exports, lead to relatively lower levels of upstream and downstream tariffs.4 The sectoral heterogeneity is however large. For example, the effect of tariffs on the cost of intermediate inputs for the local machinery industry is almost three times the manufacturing average.

59,6,6. Two simulations help illustrate the economic significance of tariff spillovers.

A second simulation studies the effect of a significant reduction in tariffs among ASEAN countries.6,FALSE,normal
59,7,"7. Focusing only on the trade channels, Indonesia could potentially benefit from a contained tariff war between the United States and China, similarly to many countries in the region. The effects of trade diversion tend to more than offset the negative spillovers along the value chain. The net positive effect for Indonesia is in part due to the country relatively moderate ties to China’s export industry. Looking at the sectoral differences, the net effects are most likely to be positive for the textile, paper and electrical sectors, which compete more directly with Chinese exports. The net effects tend to be more negative for sectors where Indonesia is higher up in relatively long value chains such as basic metals, motor vehicles and transport equipment.7",FALSE,normal
59,8,"8. Important channels such as the exchange rate and the interest rate, which tend to react to confidence shocks, are likely to make tariff wars more disruptive than illustrated above. Recent market reactions to heightened trade tensions have shown that global financial conditions can tighten quickly in response to an escalation of trade tensions. The ensuing negative effects could be more widespread and surpass the positive pure trade channel as illustrated in Chapter 1 of the IMF’s October 2018 World Economic Outlook. In particular, general equilibrium effects (for instance through wages, interest rates, and exchange rates) could reduce or more than offset the positive trade channel effect of tariff increases. Aggregate long-run results, as presented above, can also hide sectoral disruptions that can create stress in regional and sectoral markets, especially when there is no perfect mobility of workers across sectors and regions.",FALSE,normal

Nonetheless, potentially weaker-than-expected revenue, contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public- private partnerships (PPPs) should be carefully monitored. Reliance on foreign investors remains sizable, which could leave Indonesia susceptible to capital flow reversals. External Debt Sustainability",FALSE,normal
61,5,"1. Indonesia’s external debt has risen slightly to a moderate level. External debt reached 36.9 percent of GDP in 2018, up from 34.7 percent in 2017, reflecting an increase in external debt of the nonbank private sector. General government external debt has been stable, including internationally issued bonds, holdings of domestic bonds by nonresidents, and SOEs’ external loans and debt securities. External debt is projected to increase to 37.7 percent of GDP at end-2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1), driven mainly by an increase in government borrowing.",FALSE,normal
61,6,"2. External debt is projected to continue to gradually increase in the medium term. In the baseline scenario, external debt would reach 39.1 percent of GDP in 2024 reflecting the needs to finance the current account and fiscal deficits. Public and private external debt are expected to increase but total external debt is likely to remain contained at under 40 percent of GDP.",FALSE,normal
61,7,"3. External debt sustainability is robust to interest rate and GDP shocks, but is more sensitive to current account and exchange rate shocks (Figure 2). A widening of the current account deficit from current levels would cause external debt to rise moderately (a one standard deviation shock would increase external debt to 43 percent of GDP by 2024). Exchange rate depreciation would have the largest impact—a 30 percent depreciation in 2018 would raise external debt to 56 percent of GDP in 2020 and thereafter. Public Debt Sustainability",FALSE,normal
61,8,"4. Indonesia’s public sector debt remains moderate. General government debt has declined steadily from 87 percent of GDP in 2000 to 30.1 percent in 2018, owing to a prudent fiscal stance that has been anchored by fiscal rules since 2003.1 On the composition of debt, foreign-currency denominated debt stays at about 40 percent of public debt. Dependence on foreign investors remains sizable, with nonresidents holding around 60 percent of general government debt.",FALSE,normal

The baseline scenario envisages the general government deficit to remain at 1.8 percent of GDP over the medium term and a primary deficit at around 0.1−0.3 percent of GDP. The small fiscal deficits, together with favorable debt dynamics (a negative interest rate-growth differential of -0.8 percent over the medium term), would lead to a gradual reduction in public debt",FALSE,normal

70,12,"r A sse ssm e n t Foreign asset and liability position and trajectory 2018 IIP (% GDP) Background. At end-2018, Indonesia’s net international investment position (NIIP) stood at -30 percent of GDP, compared with -33 percent of GDP at end-2017 (and -39½ percent at end-2012). Gross external assets reached 33.3 percent of GDP (of which, close to 35 percent were reserve assets) and gross external liabilities, 63.8 percent of GDP. Indonesia’s gross external debt was moderate at 36.2 percent of GDP at end-2018, of which 19 percent was denominated in rupiah and 87 percent was maturing after one year. About one-third of the government’s external debt was denominated in rupiah. Assessment. The level and composition of the NIIP and gross external debt indicate that Indonesia’s external position is sustainable and subject to limited roll-over risk, but nonresident holdings of rupiah denominated government bonds, at 34 percent of the total stock (or 6.4 percent of GDP) at end 2018, combined with shallow domestic financial markets, make Indonesia susceptible to global financial volatility, higher U.S. interest rates, and stronger U.S. dollar. Staff projections for the current account suggest that the NIIP position as a percent of GDP will be stable over the medium term. Overall Assessment: The external position of Indonesia in 2018 was assessed to be moderately weaker than medium- term fundamentals and desirable policies. Exchange rate flexibility and trade-related policy actions (import compression and export promotion) together with broadly stable (projected) commodity prices are expected to modestly reduce the current account deficit over the medium term. External financing appears sustainable, although the large share of foreign portfolio holdings makes the economy vulnerable to a sharp tightening of global financial conditions. Potential policy responses: Improving Indonesia’s external position requires boosting competitiveness through higher infrastructure and social spending, while maintaining fiscal sustainability through the mobilization of revenues. In addition, structural policies are necessary to bolster global value chain participation, ease FDI and non-tariff trade restrictions, as well as strengthen labor markets and worker skills (e.g. streamlining stringent job protection, and improving job placement services, vocational training, and overall education). Flexibility of the exchange rate and market- determined bond yields should continue to support external stability. NIIP -30.5 Gross Assets 33.3 Res. Assets 11.6 Gross Liab. 63.8 Debt Liab. 36.2 Current account CA Assessment 2018 Background. After narrowing since 2013, Indonesia’s current account deficit increased to 3 percent of GDP in 2018, from a 1.6 percent deficit in 2017, driven by mainly by growing domestic demand and higher oil prices. The CA deficit is projected to narrow slightly to 2.9 percent in 2019 on the back of weaker import growth, in part due to the lagged effects of the sharp exchange rate depreciation since mid-2018 and lower oil prices. A gradual increase in manufacturing exports, underpinned by improved competitiveness and stronger demand from trading partners should help limit the current account deficit over the medium-term. Assessment. Staff estimates a CA gap of -1.5 percent for 2018, consistent with an estimated cyclically adjusted CA balance of -3.2 percent of GDP and a staff-assessed norm of -1.7 percent of GDP. 1/ Taking into account uncertainties in the estimation of the norm, the CA gap for 2018 is in the range of -3 percent to 0 percent of GDP. 2/ The offsetting impact of domestic policy gaps suggests that addressing excess imbalances will require reforms to improve labor markets and competitiveness. The lagged effects of the weaker rupiah should help improve the CA deficit in the near term. Actual CA -3.0 Cycl. Adj. CA -3.2 EBA CA Norm -0.8 EBA CA Gap -2.4 Staff Adj. -0.9 Staff CA Gap -1.5 Real exchange rate Background. The REER remained broadly stable between 2013 and 2017. In 2018, the average REER depreciated by 6.1 percent relative to the average of 2017 due to a depreciation of the nominal exchange rate by 8.5 percent from tighter global financial conditions that led to capital flow pressures. Estimates through 2019 Q1 show that the REER has appreciated by 3.1 percent relative to the 2018 average. Assessment. The EBA index and level REER models point to an REER gap of about -3.2 percent to -14.8 percent for 2018, with the change driven by the depreciation of the REER. Meanwhile, the CA gap estimate of -1.5 percent of GDP with standard elasticities and uncertainty ranges (+/-5 percent), would indicate that the REER is overvalued in the range of [3,13] percent. Taking into account the depreciation in 2018, staff assesses the REER gap to be in the -9 to 1 percent range.3/ Capital and financial accounts: flows and policy measures Background. In 2018, net capital and financial account inflows (2.5 percent of GDP) were sustained by net FDI inflows (1.4 percent of GDP), net portfolio inflows (0.9 percent of GDP), and net other investment inflows of 0.2 percent of GDP. Assessment. Net and gross financial flows have been relatively steady since the global financial crisis despite some short periods of volatility. The contained current account deficit and strengthened policy frameworks, including exchange rate flexibility since mid-2013 have also helped reduce capital flow volatility. Continued strong policies focused on strengthening the fiscal position, keeping inflation in check, and easing supply bottlenecks would help sustain capital inflows in the medium term.

70,15,"Background. Since mid-2013, Indonesia has had a more flexible exchange rate policy framework. Its floating regime has better facilitated adjustments in exchange rates to market conditions. At end-2018, reserves were US$120.7 billion (equal to 12 percent of GDP, about 118 percent of IMF’s reserve adequacy metric, and about 6.4 months of prospective imports of goods and services), compared with US$130.2 billion at end-2017. The loss in international reserves reflect mainly FX intervention in response to the disorderly market conditions triggered by the tightening of global financial conditions last year. In addition, contingencies and swap lines amounting to about US$92.5 billion are in place. Assessment. While the composite metric may not adequately account for commodity price volatility, the current level of reserves (US$124.3 billion at end-April) should provide sufficient buffer against a wide range of possible external shocks, with predetermined drains also manageable. FX intervention, while broadly appropriate last year, should continue to aim primarily at preventing disorderly market conditions, while allowing the exchange rate to adjust to external shocks.

75,6,"General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some shortcomings in fiscal and external sector statistics. National accounts: Statistics Indonesia (BPS) disseminates annual and quarterly GDP (QGDP) by economic activity and expenditure components at current prices and in volume terms at 2010 prices regularly. In general, GDP estimates are based on the latest international methodologies following the System of National Accounts 2008. The QGDP estimates are based on a limited set of indirect indicators. Some sectors are influenced strongly by seasonality, with seasonally adjusted data prepared but not published. BPS has been leading the work on developing sectoral accounts and balance sheets jointly with Bank Indonesia (BI) with TA from STA. BPS and BI expect to finalize the provisional data for the years 2010–2014 by the end of 2019. The next TA mission on Sectoral Accounts will be conducted in August 2019. Price statistics: Price statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. The index and weight refence period for PPI is 2010. In October 2013, BPS released the new Producer Price Index (PPI) covering agriculture, mining and quarrying, and manufacturing, and has published the PPI index quarterly. BPS has also expanded the mining sample to include oil and natural gas extraction, coal, and gold, and has started work to further expand PPI coverage to include 15 service industries. Currently PPI for the following service industries are disseminated: electricity, water and gas; passenger transport; hotel and restaurants. There is a need to increase dissemination frequency and update the weights for the PPI. The index and weight reference period for CPI is 2012. A recent STA TA mission assisted with improving the CPI methodology and updating weights using the results of the 2018 household expenditure survey (Survei Biaya Hidup) . The new CPI is expected from the August 2019 index. STA is assisting Bank Indonesia to develop an enhanced RPPI using Big Data on property listings. Government finance statistics (GFS): The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is committed to keeping the requirements of fiscal statistics at the forefront of ongoing fiscal reforms, with better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the current efforts. The authorities are continuing their efforts to adopt the GFSM 2001/2014 standards, with assistance from STA as part of a regional GFS project. Significant progress has been made in these areas and, Indonesia now reports to STA annual general government data (including balance sheet data) covering the period from 2008 onwards. Annual general government GFS are currently available 12 months after the end of the reference period and these data are published on the GFS website: http://www.gfs.djpbn.kemenkeu.go.id/en. The timeliness of the annual data will improve once all systems are in place. Aggregated monthly data on the budget of the central government are available with a one-month lag. In late 2015, the authorities have started to compile quarterly general government data based on estimates of local government data. Quarterly general government GFS (operations statement) are available 6 months after the end of the reference quarter. The quarterly general government data are yet to be published on the GFS website because the authorities are improving these data in terms of coverage of local governments and timeliness with the development of new regional financial information system. Limited quarterly general government GFS data are published in IFS. The coverage and timeliness of public debt statistics are generally adequate. Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) and financial soundness indicators (FSIs): Good quality monetary statistics are compiled by BI on a timely basis. BI compiles and reports monetary data using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), from which an integrated database and alternative presentations of monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the IMF. Additional challenges include timely revisions of published banking sector data after supervisory verification. With the support of a Fund TA mission in October 2014, BI expanded the coverage of the OFCs survey, which since January 2015 includes finance companies, insurance companies, pension funds, the state-owned pawn shop (PT Pegadaian), and the Indonesian export financing institution (Eximbank); achieving almost full coverage of the subsector. OFC data are reported on a monthly basis. The mission also assisted BI in advancing the production of flow-based monetary statistics and quarterly financial accounts. BI compiles and reports to the Fund all (12) core and 12 encouraged financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for deposit takers, all (two) encouraged FSIs for OFCs, two encouraged FSIs for nonfinancial corporations, one encouraged FSI for households, two encouraged FSIs for market liquidity, and three encouraged FSIs for the real estate sector, which are published quarterly on the Fund’s FSI website. Indonesia reports data on some key series and indicators of the Financial Access Survey (FAS), including mobile money and the two indicators adopted by the UN to monitor Target 8.10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). External sector statistics (ESS): Trade data have been improved in recent years. Import and export transactions of free trade zones and bonded warehouses are captured in goods data of balance of payments (BOP) statistics. For financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of direct investment (DI) data needs substantial improvement. Inflows are currently calculated based on loan disbursements to companies that have foreign equity using a fixed ratio to estimate equity inflows. The errors and omissions in BOP has been large and predominantly negative and could be related to the under coverage of imports in current account or assets in the financial account. Financial transactions data are reconciled with changes in the international investment position (IIP), except data on DI. IIP data are compiled and published annually and quarterly. External debt statistics have improved considerably with the introduction of an External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002 and the recent initiative to publish monthly indicators. Also, as a result of the ongoing reconciliation of data conducted by BI, the IIP and external debt data are fully consistent. However, improvements are still needed with respect to components of private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled and actual debt service, in estimating the accumulation/reduction of private sector payments arrears, and in estimating reschedulings/debt reductions received by the private sector from external creditors. II. Data Standards and Quality Indonesia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September 1996, observing most of the SDDS requirements. Indonesia uses the SDDS flexibility options for the timeliness of the labor market categories (employment, unemployment, and wages/earnings) and general government operations.

The consultation has provided valuable venues to discuss the many progress of home-grown policies as well as reforms that Indonesia is currently undertaking. We appreciate staff’s effort to understand the domestic economy and country specific challenges as well as authorities’ policies and objectives. The authorities are encouraged by staff’s acknowledgement of Indonesia’s solid macroeconomic performance as well as favorable outlook. Accordingly, the authorities broadly concur with the thrust of staff’s appraisal with an important caveat on key recommendations, namely on macroprudential policy. Recent Economic Development and Outlook The authorities’ policy mix has successfully preserved macroeconomic stability and maintained growth momentum amidst rising global uncertainty in 2018. Economic growth gradually improved to 5.2% in 2018, with macroeconomic and financial stability intact as indicated by low and contained inflation and well-maintained financial system stability. External stability remained solid supported by the flexible exchange rates as an important shock absorber of the economy. Appropriate policy mix was implemented last year to strengthen macroeconomic stability, particularly the external stability, while preserving economic growth momentum. Going forward, the outlook remains buoyant with economic growth expected to improve gradually in the medium term, as growth rate is seen to be slightly higher than staff’s estimates. This favorable outlook benefitted in large from the structural reform efforts, which have started to bear fruit in terms of improved productivity. For 2019, the authorities projected economic growth to be within the range of 5.0-5.4% and will continue to grow further to 5.5- 6.1% in the medium term. Inflation is forecasted to be below the midpoint of the 3.5%±1% target corridor in 2019, in line with well anchored inflation expectations. The current account deficit is expected to narrow due to various measures to curb imports and to promote exports. The authorities will continue to monitor global economic developments while assessing their policy mix. Fiscal and Structural Reforms In 2018, the authorities remain committed to maintaining fiscal sustainability, by ensuring that the primary balance and the budget deficit were below state budget target of -0.6% and 2.2% of GDP respectively. During the period of heightened global uncertainty, the authorities’ policy consideration was mainly focused on ensuring fiscal sustainability to maintain economic stability. The primary balance and the budget deficit in 2018 were smaller than the target at -0.08% and 1.8% of GDP, respectively. This has enabled the Government to maintain the official debt level at 29.8% of GDP, far below the legal threshold of 60% of GDP. Going forward, the policy thrust will be to preserve fiscal sustainability while supporting",FALSE,normal

79,4,"economic growth. Overall, the authorities agreed on the merits of a broadly neutral fiscal stance. The Government has set the target for primary balance and budget deficit in 2019 to be -0.12% and 1.84% of GDP, respectively. The authorities concur with staff that revenue mobilization should be a top fiscal reform priority to build the fiscal buffers. In this vein, the comprehensive tax reform has been focused on improving tax administration, streamlining tax structures, broadening the tax base, and increasing compliance in order to increase fiscal buffer. The authorities supports the improvement of tax revenue mobilization through integrated and up-to-date data and information utilization, international tax treaty optimization, and the effectiveness of Automatic Exchange of Information implementation. The authorities have also been simplifying tax structures as a part of a tax reform plan and reviewing the income tax and value-added tax law.1 They will also lessen the complexity of the current tax system, including to review tax exemptions to ensure the effectiveness. To this end, the authorities would welcome the IMF’s support to enhance the current draft amendment of the income tax law. On the expenditure side, the authorities will maintain their efforts to further improve the quality of public spending. This includes refocusing priority spending on infrastructure, ensuring efficiency in spending, as well as implementing better-targeted subsidies and more effective social protection programs. In this view, the Government implemented several short- term measures to stimulate the economy, while keeping long-term measures to boost the productivity including through human capital quality improvement. To this end, the authorities welcome the IMF’s expertise to improve government capital expenditure strategy through technical assistance and capacity development. The authorities remain committed to energy subsidy reform, and will ensure that the economy can adjust smoothly. Gradual implementation of subsidy reform will be complemented by targeted measures for the vulnerable groups. The authorities will also continue to pursue structural reforms to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. Expanding infrastructures investment, improving the business climate, and promoting financial market deepening are some of the noteworthy actions. In order to maintain a healthy investment climate, the authorities commit to maintain market confidence. The authorities’ steadfast implementation of the structural reform agenda as well as consistent performance in terms of macroeconomic stability have been recognized by the credit rating agencies. S&P has upgraded Indonesia’s rating to BBB from BBB- with a stable outlook in May 2019. Therefore, Indonesia’s sovereign ratings from all of the three major rating agencies, S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch, are currently one notch above minimum investment grade level. Authorities agree that maintaining market confidence is crucial in the period of global uncertaity. While financial market deepening is a strategic policy for strengthening economic resilience, the fact that most of export proceed never return to or stays in Indonesia has hampered financial deepening process and impacted domestic financial market. As a natural resource base economy, the repatriation of natural resource export proceed to Indonesia is very important for the economy to address the structural issues related to economic development.",FALSE,normal

80,4,"Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Monetary policy has focused on maintaining macroeconomic stability amidst heightened global uncertainty. In this regard, the central bank employed various policy instruments, including monetary policy rate, exchange rate flexibility, and foreign exchange intervention to meet its objectives. In 2018, Bank Indonesia (BI) pursued a preemptive, front-loading, and ahead-of-the- curve policy by raising the policy rate by 175 bps to weather risks posed by interest rate hike in the US and other emerging markets, as well as uncertainty in global financial markets.2 Looking ahead, BI concurs with staff’s suggestion to cautiously consider the room for accommodative monetary policy to help stimulate domestic economy while ensuring inflation remains on target. Nevertheless, BI remains mindful of the global financial market dynamics and external stability and will undertake a comprehensive assessment of the policy direction to avoid adverse effects to macroeconomic and financial stability. The authorities affirmed their commitment to allow exchange rate flexibility to serve as a shock absorber. In this context, intervention in the FX market will be limited to curbing excessive volatility. On the IMF’s advice to publish the Forex Intervention (FXI) data, BI views that this requires prerequisite conditions to be met such as the existence of a deep, efficient and market driven foreign exchange market. BI will reconsider the publication of the FXI data once these preconditions are fulfilled. BI continues to enhance its monetary operation strategy to maintain adequate liquidity in the money market and banking sector, especially during periods of high market volatility. In this light, BI increased the auction frequency of government securities reverse repo, reactivated the BI Certificate auctions, conducted forex swap auctions, and increased the portion of average statutory reserve requirement.3 The implementation of reserve requirement (RR) averaging is aimed at giving more flexibility to banks in managing their liquidity, which can reduce the volatility of the interbank money market and strengthen the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The authorities took note of staff’s recommendation on expanding the coverage of the averaging portion to all portions of the RR. BI will consider staff’s advice when reviewing the effectiveness of RR averaging.",FALSE,normal

80,6,"2 The preemptive increases in the policy rate, namely BI 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (BI7DRR), were linked to the forward-looking, anticipatory response of Bank Indonesia to the risk of increases in the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) and uncertainty on global financial markets. The front-loading response meant that the magnitude of the increase in the Indonesian policy rate had considered the possible extent of an increase in the FFR, so that the interest rate differential would remain sufficiently large to maintain the attractiveness of domestic assets. Alongside this, the ahead-of-the-curve response was related to the fact that the magnitude of Indonesia’s policy rate increases would also anticipate interest rate increases in other emerging markets so that the domestic financial market would remain competitive.",FALSE,normal

81,4,"External Sector In 2018, the heightened global uncertainties posed increasing risk on external stability. This unfavorable condition adversely affected BoP performance, adding pressure to the rupiah, particularly during the second and third quarter of 2018. The policy mix executed by the authorities helped restore Indonesia’s external stability. The current account deficit was kept at 2.98% of GDP for the whole 2018, despite widening to 3.6% of GDP in the fourth quarter. The current account deficit then narrowed to 2.6% of GDP in the first quarter of 2019. The improving trend of capital inflows by non-residents in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, together with the narrowing current account deficit in the first quarter of 2019, had a positive effect on external sector balance. The BoP eventually returned to surplus in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019. External stability was further bolstered by adequate reserve assets to cover imports and to service government external debt, well above the international reserve adequacy standard of three months of imports. Reiterating previous Article IV consultation, authorities view the estimated CA norm resulting from EBA model to be too low and does not adequately reflect Indonesia’s need for higher investment and structural reforms. We encourage staff to consider how to better incorporate country-specific factors in the assessment of the current account norm, in particular the substantial infrastructure investment needs and critical structural reforms that the country is undertaking to promote sustainable growth. External debt remained sustainable, including private debt. The authorities believe this favorable environment was backed by the prudential regulations on external borrowings. The corporate sector external debt regulation was aimed at ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability through the implementation of prudential principles on corporate foreign borrowings.4 The authorities will review regularly the appropriateness of this regulation in supporting external stability. Going forward, external stability is projected to improve. The current account deficit is predicted to ease, supported by close coordination between BI and the Government to address the issue, including through various measures to curb excessive import and to promote export. The current account deficit is projected at about 2.5–3.0 % of GDP in 2019 and will decline further in the medium-term. The capital and financial account surplus is also set to improve, exceeding the level achieved in 2018, bolstered mainly by higher inflows of FDI, improvements in the business climate, and a solid domestic economy outlook. Macroprudential and Financial Sector Policy Macroprudential policy will continue to safeguard financial system stability and mitigate systemic risk. Nevertheless, in the event that the financial cycle is below the long-term trend, macroprudential policy can be calibrated to support a more balanced growth of credit. The current accommodative macroprudential policy has helped boost bank lending growth. Meanwhile, financial system stability continues to be maintained by a well-capitalized banking",FALSE,normal

82,4,"sector. Going forward, the authorities view that there is room to maintain current accomodative macroprudential policy, while remaining vigilant to ensure financial system stability. Financial system stability was maintained, underpinned by a robust banking capital position and adequate liquidity, as well as improvement in corporate financing. At the end of 2018, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) and the liquid assets to deposits ratio stood at 22.9% and 19.3%, respectively. Credit growth was at 11.8%, while credit risk was kept within prudent limits as reflected in the low NPL ratios of 2.4% (gross) and 1.0% (net), both of which were within the 5% sound territory. Improvement also took place in non-bank financing. Total issuance of shares (IPOs and rights issues), corporate bonds, medium-term notes and negotiable certificate of deposits (NCDs), all representing various forms of financing from the capital market, were recorded at IDR168.1 trillion (gross). This points to an improvement in corporate financing from domestic sources, including from both banks and the capital market. The authorities have made encouraging progress in harnessing the benefits and opportunities of rapid advances in the digital economy which have transformed the economic and financial landscape, while at the same time managing emerging risks. In this context, authorities have outlined a vision of Indonesia’s Payment System (IPS) 2025 as well as an initiative for a new payment system blueprint to ensure that the current trend of digitalization develops within a conducive digital economic and financial ecosystem, along the lines of Bali Fintech Agenda. Financial Market Deepening (FMD) In 2018, the FMD policy was focused on improving the efficiency of money and forex markets to lay the foundation for promoting long-term economic financing. BI has taken several actions by introducing domestic non-deliverable forward (DNDF) transaction, developing market for call spread options (CSOs), establishing Indonesia Overnight Index Average (IndONIA) as a benchmark rate on the Rupiah money market and as a reference rate for Overnight Index Swap (OIS), as well as strengthening the Jakarta Interbank Offered Rate (JIBOR). BI, MoF, and OJK have also developed more innovative financing schemes to finance infrastructure development in Indonesia, including public-private partnerships (PPP), project bonds, infrastructure funds, asset and earning backed securities as well as blended finance. After successfully launching the SDG One Blended Finance roadmap at the IMF- World Bank Annual Meetings in Bali, the Indonesian government also released the first Green Sukuk bond at the beginning of this year. This represents Indonesia’s tangible and avowed commitment to environmental infrastructure development. The authorities also strengthened coordination to speed up financial market deepening. To that end, BI, the MoF, OJK have established the Coordination Forum on Development Financing by means of Financial Market.5 The Coordination Forum was mandated to formulate a National Financial Market Development and Deepening Strategy as a comprehensive and measurable single policy framework oriented towards realizing the vision of creating deep, liquid, efficient, inclusive and secure financial markets.6 The authorities have introduced a",FALSE,normal

Conclusion Indonesia’s economy continues to perform well, underpinned by sound macroeconomic policy aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability while also promoting higher potential growth. The authorities’ policy-mix has successfully preserved macroeconomic stability and maintained the growth momentum amidst rising global uncertainty in 2018. The central bank policies were brought into synergy with the Government’s fiscal and structural reform policies. Fiscal policy was aimed to preserve fiscal sustainability outlook, while also providing room to promote economic growth.
