2,5,"IMF Executive Board Concludes 2018 Article IV Consultation with Japan On November 21, 2018, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Japan. The Japanese economy is growing above its estimated potential. After a temporary soft patch early in the year, domestic demand recovered in the second quarter. With external demand expected to remain supportive, and despite recent natural disasters, real GDP growth is projected to remain above trend in 2018 at 1.1 percent. Headline and core inflation have gained momentum in recent months on the back of higher energy prices but remain well below Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) two percent inflation target. The current account surplus increased marginally in 2017, due to a stronger income balance, but is expected to shrink by the end of 2018 due to smaller goods trade and income balances. The real effective exchange rate appreciated slightly in the first nine months of 2018 relative to end- 2017. As with the 2017 external sector assessment, the projected 2018 current account balance is preliminarily assessed as in line with the current account level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. Underlying growth is expected to remain solid, notwithstanding the scheduled increase in the consumption tax rate in October 2019. However, absent mitigating fiscal measures, the consumption tax increase could lead to volatility in private consumption and investment. Meanwhile, monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative and support favorable financial conditions. Over the medium term, growth is projected to moderate and the output gap close. Following a consumption tax-induced spike in 2020, inflation will rise over the medium term, but likely remain below the BoJ’s target.",TRUE,normal

3,2,"Executive Board Assessment2 Executive Directors welcomed Japan’s remarkable economic growth performance, especially in per capita terms, and the prospect of continued above-potential growth in the near term. Directors nevertheless noted that inflation remains below target and that downside risks have risen, notably from the upcoming consumption tax rate increase and deteriorating global conditions. Moreover, intensifying demographic headwinds continue to pose challenges. Directors emphasized the need to reinvigorate the policies of “Abenomics” to achieve sustained high growth, durable reflation, and public debt sustainability. Directors generally underscored the importance of maintaining a neutral fiscal stance to support near-term growth and reflation. They welcomed the authorities’ plan to implement temporary measures to alleviate the adverse impact of the scheduled increase in the consumption tax rate, accompanied by clear communication to the public. For the medium term, Directors saw merit in developing a well-specified fiscal framework, based on realistic assumptions, to reduce policy uncertainty and anchor a gradual consolidation path toward debt sustainability while addressing demographic challenges. While an independent fiscal institution could be helpful in this regard, some Directors saw scope to achieve these objectives within the existing institutional arrangements. Directors welcomed the authorities’ ambitious structural reform agenda aimed at lifting potential growth. They stressed the importance of strong government commitment to mutually-supportive reforms, with priority given to labor market reforms to enhance labor supply including from female, older, and foreign workers. Directors recommended further efforts to eliminate tax and social security disincentives to full-time and regular work, reduce the gender wage gap, and increase the availability of childcare and nursing facilities. They also encouraged the authorities to further deregulate product and services markets, facilitate entry and exit of firms, promote small- and medium-sized enterprises, and deepen corporate governance reform. Directors agreed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, possibly for an extended period to successfully reflate the economy, while carefully monitoring and mitigating side- effects. They stressed that effective communication and forward guidance would help reduce market volatility and guide inflation expectations. Directors recognized the challenges facing the financial sector, especially from demographic pressures and low interest rates. They welcomed the progress made in implementing the 2017 FSAP recommendations, in particular, the new more forward-looking supervisory framework.",TRUE,normal

They welcomed the authorities’ close engagement with regional financial institutions to help adapt their business models to demographic trends. Directors also saw priority in facilitating financial institutions’ use of Fintech and strengthening crypto-asset oversight. Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that Japan’s 2018 external position and real exchange rate are projected to be broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. They agreed that a credible fiscal consolidation plan combined with bolder structural reforms are needed to maintain external balance over the medium term. Directors also noted that advancing multilateralism would help mitigate inward spillovers from heightened trade tensions, and appreciated Japan’s leadership role on this front. Directors commended the authorities for volunteering to participate in the Fund’s initiative to assess efforts to address supply-side of corruption in Japan’s Article IV consultation. They looked forward to continued progress in enforcing foreign bribery laws.",TRUE,normal

6,6,"KEY ISSUES Context: The rapid aging and shrinking of Japan’s population will dominate economic policy making in coming decades—impelling a fresh look at the objectives and tools of Abenomics. Six years of Abenomics have yielded some important results, but achieving sustained high growth and durable reflation, while also tackling debt sustainability and a shifting global economic landscape, will require strengthened policies.",FALSE,normal
6,7,"Outlook and risks: Underlying growth is expected to remain solid, notwithstanding the scheduled increase in the consumption tax rate, and growth will move closer to potential over the medium term. Inflation is likely to remain below the Bank of Japan’s two-percent target under current policies. In line with the global outlook, the balance of risks has shifted to the downside. Japan’s macro-financial vulnerabilities, fiscal consolidation needs, and limited monetary policy space make the economy vulnerable to adverse shocks—particularly over the medium term as demographic trends intensify.",FALSE,normal
6,8,"Policies: The consultation centered on the macroeconomic effects of Japan’s demographics—a rapidly-aging and shrinking population—which under current policies implies a commensurate drag on real output. Mutually-supportive, reinvigorated, and credible policies are needed to bring Abenomics to full strength, to boost productivity and raise potential growth. Budgetary and income policies anchored by a well-specified and gradual medium-term fiscal consolidation plan would help support the Bank of Japan’s reflation efforts and ensure debt sustainability. Macro-structural reforms—with a level of government commitment and steady implementation that inspire public confidence—are imperative to unleash productivity gains, lift long-run growth, stabilize government debt, and counter deflationary effects. Monetary policy accommodation should be maintained, but more can be done to further strengthen the monetary policy framework and lift inflation expectations. Strengthened financial sector policies would lessen the financial risks from demographic headwinds, prolonged low interest rates, and low profitability.",FALSE,normal

This clears the way for PM Abe to remain in office into 2021, which would make him Japan’s longest-serving prime minister. Abe’s reelection also allows the policies of Abenomics to continue. However, the internal LDP leadership debate highlighted several economic concerns resonating with Japanese public opinion—including high public debt, stagnation of household incomes, and the unevenness of economic gains.

Real GDP growth is projected to stay above potential in 2018 at 1.1 percent, assuming that external demand remains supportive and the economy bounces back from recent natural disasters. Without effective mitigating measures, the implementation of the consumption tax increase is likely to lead to volatility in private consumption and investment. The effect of the tax increase is expected to carry past 2019 and adversely affect domestic demand and overall growth in 2020. Over the medium term, growth is expected to moderate and the output gap to close. Following a consumption tax-induced spike in 2020, inflation will rise over the medium term, but likely remain below target (see Annex III).",FALSE,normal

Moreover, a disorderly tightening of global financial conditions could increase macro-financial risks, with financial institutions particularly sensitive to a sharp fall in equity prices or a spike in JGB yields.

A reinvigorated structural reform agenda should boost productivity, labor supply, and investment, while strengthening the credibility of the reforms would support reflation.11 The government has properly identified areas for reform, but gaps remain and implementation has been slow. Staff analysis finds that under current policies real GDP will decline by over 25 percent in 40 years due to demographics (Box 3). Credible implementation of all structural reforms (as outlined below), accompanied by a continued accommodative monetary stance and public debt stabilization, could significantly boost real GDP. Additionally, a credible reform program would help reflation as the demand boost due to anticipation effects (as firms and households increase investment and consumption due to higher expected capital returns and permanent income) exceeds the contemporaneous supply boost from the reform plan. While there is a range of uncertainties around such long-run model simulations, the simulations suggest that real GDP could be higher by as much as 15 percent in 40 years due to credible reforms, relative to the current-policies scenario. By contrast, a not-fully-believed path of reforms would deliver significantly lower effects on near-term real GDP (8 percent boost in 10 years), would not help inflation reach BoJ’s two-percent target, and would lead to a smaller decline in the government long-run debt-to-GDP ratio.",FALSE,normal

Backward-looking inflation expectations (Box 1), structural rigidities, and adverse demographic trends are clogging the monetary transmission mechanism and reducing the effectiveness of monetary stimulus. These factors have manifested themselves in a narrow gap between the short-term actual and natural real interest rates (Box 4). Given the limited progress of monetary policy to generate inflationary pressures since the introduction of Abenomics, the BoJ must maintain the accommodative stance for a prolonged period. Continued efforts to make the accommodative stance more sustainable— including by mitigating side-effects from prolonged monetary easing—are crucial and consistent with a more patient approach to reaching the inflation target.",FALSE,normal

Policy normalization by other major central banks and concerns about financial sector side-effects have complicated BoJ’s reflation efforts and market communication. While the recent commitment to keep interest rates low for an extended period should help stem market speculation over an earlier-than-expected normalization, further improvements to the communication framework are imperative to enhance policy predictability and generate public support for achieving the inflation target. Specifically, the relationship between forward guidance on the long-term interest rate target and the inflation target could be clarified and the quantitative guidance on JGB purchases could be removed.15 To strengthen the policy framework and help lift inflation expectations, the BoJ should consider moving closer to full-fledged inflation targeting by publishing BoJ’s staff baseline forecast together with underlying policy assumptions. This should help reduce the discrepancy between market and the BoJ Board’s inflation forecasts by enhancing the public’s understanding of monetary policy as well as reducing the likelihood of overly optimistic inflation forecasts by BoJ Board members (see text figure).",FALSE,normal

Financial Sector Policies—Containing Risks",FALSE,normal
23,6,"27. Japan’s financial sector remains stable, but low interest rates and demographic headwinds are undercutting profitability and encouraging risk taking. The overall banking sector remains well capitalized and liquid. Nonetheless, the amount of risks taken by some financial institutions have exceeded their capital levels. Market risks from a large decline in equity prices or a sharp rise in JGB yields could lead to substantial losses for major banks and life insurers, while solvency concerns and higher risk taking due to demographic challenges and low interest rates are more severe for regional banks. In particular, the riskiness of credit allocation has increased significantly in recent years on the back of strong growth in lending to small enterprises, and exceeded the levels seen during the global financial crisis.16 Meanwhile, the ratio of real estate loans-to-GDP has reached an historic high. Moreover, banks have increased substantially their holdings of investment trusts while long-term investors have stepped up their risk taking in foreign securities.17 Risks associated with these activities should be carefully monitored and assessed against financial institutions’ risk management capacity. Recent stress testing conducted by the BoJ highlighted authorities’ concerns over the impact of low profitability on capital levels, and increased lending to financially vulnerable firms.",FALSE,normal
23,7,"16 An increase in the riskiness of credit allocation signals heightened downside risks to GDP growth and a higher probability of banking crises and banking sector stress. Most of the small-enterprise lending is extended by regional banks to the real estate sector, and hence may be at higher risk given that the rising condominium prices are assessed to be moderately overvalued and that demographic changes are expected to put significant downward pressures on equilibrium prices in the medium- to long-term. 17 Banks’ holdings of investment trusts increased from about ¥6 trillion in 2013 to over ¥18 trillion in August 2017— over 80 percent of the increase was contributed by regional financial institutions.",FALSE,normal

On the other hand, speculation over earlier-than- expected policy normalization in Japan could cause a significant shift in global market perceptions and accelerate global financial tightening. Moreover, growing differentials between global and domestic interest rates could encourage investors to take unhedged yen carry trade positions. A sharp reversal of these positions, due to heightened global uncertainty from trade or geopolitical tensions, could lead to a large and sudden appreciation of the yen. While a yen appreciation could help boost foreign investors’ asset returns, it could also adversely affect BoJ’s efforts to reflate the economy (see Box 6).20",FALSE,normal

A global retreat from cross-border integration would likely reduce Japan’s net exports, investment and growth, including from direct and indirect effects via global value chains and adverse spillovers to the financial sector. For example, the October 2018 World Economic Outlook estimates that if the U.S. imposes the threatened 25 percent tariff on imported cars and car parts in 2019 (with trading partners responding with tariffs on an equivalent amount of U.S. goods exports), Japan will have a notable decline in output (i.e. long-run decline of almost 0.2 percent).

There are currently 104 regional banks operating in Japan’s 47 prefectures, accounting for 45 percent of outstanding domestic loans. Deposits—which account for about 90 percent of liabilities—are used to extend loans (64 percent of assets), primarily to SMEs and households but also to invest in securities (22 percent). About half of regional banks’ total income now comes from lending operations, while interest income from securities and fee income account for 19 and 17 percent, respectively.",FALSE,normal
34,6,"The traditional business model of regional banks is being challenged by adverse demographic trends and prolonged low interest rates. The dependence on regional lending has left many regional banks vulnerable to shrinking and aging prefectural populations.2 A smaller and older population typically translates into lower loan demand, increased competition between banks, and lower core profitability (i.e., lending and fee business). In fact, the share of regional banks earning negative core profits rose from 12 percent in 2011 to over 50 percent in 2018 (see figure). Moreover, because deposit growth has proven less sensitive to demographic trends than loan growth, the loan-deposit ratios of regional banks have fallen. Excess liquidity combined with low interest rates have induced banks to search for other higher yielding investment opportunities.",FALSE,normal

Fees and commissions account for a much smaller share of total income in regional banks than that of major banks, and are more concentrated in fund-transfer services and sales of investment trusts. Regional banks have been taking measures to boost and diversify fee-based income, including from business matching and succession. Experience in other countries has shown that unbundling banking services and charging fees for routine banking transactions may also help boost profits, although competitive pressures have prevented Japanese banks from introducing such fees on their own. Moreover, Fintech (including the open API) has the potential to help raise profitability (e.g., by improving the efficiency of human resources and by broadening the customer base through better information and data sharing), but may also increase competition among financial institutions.",FALSE,normal

Regional banks should enhance their risk management framework, particularly the capacity of credit and market risk assessment.

36,5,"Reform scenario. Within the structural reform program proposed, labor market reforms are the main driver of estimated real GDP effects. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to decline due to the GDP increase, including from higher inflation, and also due to the assumed debt reduction from the reform-generated boost in tax revenues. A relative increase in investment drives the reduction in the external current account in the medium term (by over 1 percent of GDP), with the assumed fiscal consolidation dampening the size of the current account reduction. Simulation results shown represent an upper bound as they assume full credibility of reforms, where private sector agents have perfect foresight of the path of the reform program, which generates boosted anticipation effects, including higher inflation. Moreover, results shown assume that the labor market duality reform entails a gradual but full catch up in the productivity of non-regular workers to that of regular workers, providing an upper bound in terms of potential productivity gains (boosting real GDP by over 6 percent in the long run), while it does not assume a significant change in workers’ bargaining power. Alternatively, assuming that only half of the productivity difference (between non-regular and regular workers) is closed, the labor market duality reform is estimated to deliver smaller real GDP gains (by about 3 percentage points in the long run).",FALSE,normal

37,5,"The aging and shrinking population of Japan could lower the natural rate of interest and, together with low inflation expectations, challenge the Bank of Japan’s efforts to reflate the economy.2 The secular stagnation hypothesis posits that fundamental factors including demographics have played a significant role in driving down natural rates in major advanced economies in recent years, by reducing the labor force and slowing productivity growth. Given the effective lower bound and historically low natural rate of interest in Japan, it is difficult to widen the interest rate gap—the gap between the real interest rate and the natural rate—and achieve sufficient monetary easing if demographic change is placing significant downward pressures on the natural rate.",FALSE,normal
37,6,"The semi-structural model developed by previous studies is extended, and a Bayesian approach is used to estimate the impact of demographic change on the natural rate of interest in Japan. The empirical framework is based on the work of Laubach and Williams (2003) and Pescatori and Turunen (2016).3 By using the production function approach, the framework explicitly models the impact of demographic changes (particularly total and working-age population growth) on the natural rate through the potential growth channel. Other channels, for example, by increasing the dependency ratio and thereby lowering the savings rate, are not explicitly captured by this model. Having said that, including the dependency ratio as an exogenous variable in the model does not alter the results qualitatively. Moreover, we follow Pescatori and Turunen (2016) and use a Bayesian approach to estimate the model, which incorporates prior information on the output gap and includes other exogenous observables (e.g., excess global savings and risk premium) as potential determinants of the natural rate.",FALSE,normal
37,7,"The estimates suggest that demographic changes have contributed to the decline in Japan’s natural rate, with the contribution increasing over time. We find that, since the Global Financial Crisis, the decline in working-age population growth has contributed about -0.3 percentage points (ppts) on average to the estimated negative natural rate—which averaged about -0.7 percent (Bayesian median) during this period. More importantly, such a negative impact is found to be increasing gradually over time, from less than -0.2 ppts in Q1 2010 to -0.4 percentage points in Q1 2018. Other shocks to trend potential growth (such as technology and other productivity shocks), excess global savings, and equity risk premium also played an important role in driving the natural rate.",FALSE,normal
37,8,"The results also suggest that Japan’s natural rate has likely fallen into negative territory, highlighting the need to implement structural reforms to boost potential growth and lift the natural rate. With the working- age population growth projected to decline by 2040, the negative demographic impact on the natural rate is likely to increase, which may further limit the role of monetary policy in reflating the economy. These findings highlight the importance of boosting potential growth by, for example, accelerating labor market and other structural reforms (including more active migration policies) to offset the increasingly adverse demographic impact and raise the natural rate in Japan.",FALSE,normal

38,5,"Crypto-asset trading in Japan experienced explosive growth in 2017. Since becoming a legal form of payment in April 2017, trading of crypto-assets in both spot and derivatives markets has grown rapidly. However, financial institutions have been cautious about trading crypto-assets or partnering with crypto- asset exchanges (CAEs) due to extremely high price volatility and concerns over cyber risk.2 The largely retail investor base has limited direct linkages with the rest of the financial system and hence immediate risks to financial stability appear low. Nonetheless, recent hacking incidents have led to large losses (about $580 million in total) for customers and the hacked exchanges, raising public concerns over cybersecurity and customer protection.",FALSE,normal
38,6,"Japan became the first country to regulate CAEs in 2017 through a registration process. Regulation of CAEs in Japan consists of four layers, with the first two legally binding (see figure). The first layer consists of two Acts on payments and AML/CFT, which require CAEs to register with the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA) and to conduct “know-your- customer” procedures. The second layer, created by a Cabinet Office Ordinance, sets forth the detailed rules for CAEs. The third layer is the JFSA’s guidelines for the registration process, which specifies the scope, timeline, and requirements of registration. The last layer encompasses self-regulation as proposed by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (which consists of the 16 registered CAEs). Self-regulation focuses mainly on business appropriateness (including caps on margin trading), market fairness (including consumer protection), and sound business development.",FALSE,normal
38,7,"JFSA has stepped up supervision of all CAEs and tightened regulation. After conducting on-site inspections in the aftermath of the January 2018 hacking incident at Coincheck, the JFSA issued business improvement orders to the exchanges with weak AML/CFT measures or customer protection systems to strengthen their internal control and governance. The JFSA has also strengthened the registration process by implementing more rigorous screening for risk-management procedures.",FALSE,normal
38,8,"Managing reputational risk remains a challenge. CAEs are typically more vulnerable to cyber risk than banks. They typically lack the same level of cybersecurity as banks yet provide similar custody services (custody of crypto-assets) to customers. Given that Japan is taking a regulatory approach towards crypto- assets, cyber attacks may result in significant reputational risk for the JFSA in addition to losses for consumers and CAEs. To this end, the JFSA needs to further enhance its resources and expertise in cybersecurity. Clear communication with the public about the JFSA’s role in the regulatory framework may help increase public awareness of the risks involved in crypto-assets and limit the reputational risk. The JFSA’s commitment to promote global cooperation to form regulations on crypto-assets as the chair of the 2019 G20 should help leverage international experiences and contribute to multilateral responses to risk from crypto-assets.",FALSE,normal

39,5,"Rising global interest rates, combined with BoJ’s yield curve control, should weaken the yen and raise inflation. But widening interest rate differentials also encourage investors to take unhedged short positions in yen to earn the interest rate carry. An initial yen appreciation (triggered by global uncertainty and a flight to safety) could result in a sudden unwinding of these positions—amplifying the yen appreciation and undermining BoJ’s efforts to reflate the economy. Safe haven effects, interest rate differentials and carry trade reversals could drive sudden yen appreciations. Safe haven appreciations occur during heightened market uncertainty when investors move into assets that are perceived as “safe”—such as Japanese government bonds (JGBs). Carry trade is an investment strategy under which investors borrow (short) in a low- interest rate currency (e.g., yen) and invest (long) in a high-interest currency (e.g. the Australian dollar). Because these positions are typically leveraged and unhedged, any initial appreciation of the funding currency can generate a sharp unwinding of these positions, which in turn reinforces the appreciation.",FALSE,normal
39,6,"Rising global rates may increase the risk of a sudden and large yen appreciation. Empirical evidence shows that safe haven effects and carry trade reversals can trigger and amplify yen appreciations. For instance, in 2005 the U.S.-Japan interest rate differential rose sharply as the Fed tightened policy, leading to a weaker yen. However, it also spurred an expansion of carry trade (short) positions in the yen. By early 2006, global risk perception had risen and BoJ signaled an exit from quantitative easing. As investors unwound carry trade positions, the yen appreciated sharply (estimates suggest the carry trade reversal explains about 40 percent of the appreciation).",FALSE,normal
39,7,"Risks are rising: As in 2006, the current rise in global rates could lead to a large carry trade position and raise the risk of a sudden and large yen appreciation. Empirical evidence also suggests that safe haven effects are likely to be significantly larger in times of heightened uncertainty. The current conjecture of widening U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials, and heightened global policy uncertainty (e.g., due to trade wars), appears particularly conducive exchange rate volatility due to the carry trade activities.",FALSE,normal
39,8,"Stay the course: Notwithstanding a potentially higher risk of a sudden yen appreciation, the BoJ should maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance and the zero-interest rate target on the benchmark 10-year JGB yield.

58,5,"1. Potential output is an important indicator for economic policy making. Potential output helps gauge a country’s current economic health and expectations of future growth, and provides a foundation for the discussion of economic policies. Despite its clear importance, a degree of uncertainty exists around the estimates, often due to a wide array of methodologies and judgements used by those estimating potential output and growth.",FALSE,normal
58,6,"2. Potential output and the output gap are estimated by applying a multivariate filter model (MVF) and a production-function approach. We use two different methodologies to estimate potential output and better understand its drivers. First, a MVF approach developed by the IMF’s Research Department is used to estimate the GDP growth rate and the output gap. This model uses Bayesian techniques to estimate potential output based on a model that incorporates the relationship between cyclical unemployment and inflation (Phillips curve), as well as the relationship between cyclical unemployment and the output gap (Okun’s law).2 Second, we complement the results from the MVF approach with a production-function approach to better understand the drivers of growth over the medium-term.3",FALSE,normal
58,7,"3. According to both approaches, Japan’s potential growth will stabilize at around 0.5– 0.6 percent over the medium-run and the output gap, which is estimated to be negative for 2018, will close in 2019. Consistent with the team’s projection using a production-function approach (labeled as WEO in Figure A), the results from MVF (labeled as MVF in Figure A) suggests that annual potential growth will stabilize over the medium-term at around 0.5–0.6 percent. Estimates of output gap up to 2018 will remain negative, and the gap is expected to close in 2019. While a small negative output gap reappears in 2020 (due to the consumption tax increase in 2019Q4), the gap closes from 2021 onwards.",FALSE,normal

59,7,"4. There are some differences in the estimates of Japan’s potential growth and output gap published by various institutions. IMF staff’s current estimate of potential growth is around 0.8 percent (y/y growth). This is close to the estimate by the Bank of Japan (0.85 percent), but lower than the estimate of the Japan’s Cabinet Office (about 1.0 percent) (see Figure B). The difference in the estimates across institutions is starker for the output gap. IMF staff’s output gap estimate suggests that the Japanese economy still has a negative (but shrinking) output gap of -0.8 percent for 2017, while those by the Japanese authorities suggest a positive output gap for the same year (Cabinet Office: 0.5 percent, Bank of Japan: 1.2 percent). In all cases, the output gap is measured as the ratio of the difference between actual output and potential output over potential output. The differences in output gap estimates across institutions, despite only small differences in potential growth, stem largely from differing views adopted by IMF staff and the Japanese authorities on potential growth during and after the Global Financial Crisis in 2008.",FALSE,normal

60,5,"1. Financial conditions have tightened modestly since the beginning of 2018. A financial conditions index (FCI) is constructed for Japan as the first principal component of JGB yield spreads, money market spreads, credit spreads of corporate bonds, movement in asset prices, the nominal effective exchange rate, and credit to corporate and household sectors. The FCI shows accommodative financial conditions since the introduction of Abenomics, but conditions have recently started to tighten. Despite low JGB yields, term premia, and credit spreads, stock prices have declined, the yen has appreciated in effective terms, and U.S. dollar funding costs have continued to rise since the beginning of 2018. Meanwhile, credit growth to the private sector has weakened.",FALSE,normal
60,6,"2. The credit cycle in Japan has likely fallen below trend since the last quarter of 2017. The credit cycle is measured by the first principal component of two credit cycle indicators, calculated by detrending the year-on-year real credit growth and the credit-to-GDP ratio with a HP filter. The estimated first principal component suggests a slight tightening in the credit cycle since Q4 2017, in line with slowing credit growth. However, the two indicators have started to diverge since then. The real credit gap suggests a below-trend expansion in the cycle, while the credit-to-GDP gap shows a continued above-trend cyclical expansion.",FALSE,normal
60,7,"3. The tightening FCI and credit cycle may weigh on economic growth going forward. To explore the relationship between the financial variables and the business cycle, a simple autoregression (VAR) model is built with the FCI (without credit variables), real GDP growth, core core inflation (excluding fresh food and energy), short-term interest rate (uncollateralized overnight call market rate), and the credit cycle indicators in Japan as endogenous variables.

61,5,"4. Financial conditions in Japan can be significantly affected by global and domestic monetary policies, and, to some extent, global uncertainty. A VAR model with VIX, short- and long-term interest rates in the U.S. and Japan, and the FCI (without credit variables) is estimated to identify the impact of global uncertainty (measured by VIX) and the U.S. and domestic monetary policies. The 3-month and 10- year sovereign bond yields of the U.S. and Japan are used to capture monetary policy shocks in the two countries. The impulse response functions suggest that all the variables could have significant effects on financial conditions in Japan. Specifically, a one-s.d. increase in the VIX could lead to a tightening in the FCI by more than 0.1. More importantly, a 25-basis point (bp) increase in the 3-month interest rates of the U.S. and Japan could cause a significant tightening in the FCI by about 0.1 and 0.7 at the peak, respectively. Similarly, a 25-bp tightening in the 10-year U.S. and Japanese interest rates could tighten the FCI by more than 0.1 and 0.8 at the peak, respectively. Given that Japan’s monetary policy is constrained by the effective lower bound (short end) and the low profitability of financial institutions (long end), the ability of domestic monetary policy to mitigate the global financial tightening in a scenario with disorderly tightening in the U.S. monetary policy and heightened global uncertainty could be limited.",FALSE,normal

Drivers of Japan’s growth over the medium term include favorable external demand and supportive monetary policy, which translate into a weaker Japanese yen and below-equilibrium real interest rates in the model. Projected fluctuations over the medium term are mostly due to the consumption tax increase in 2019Q4, which will lead to a temporary boost in growth prior to the fourth quarter of 2019. This will be followed by a sharp slowdown in subsequent periods—consistent with the consumption tax experience of 2014. The economy is projected to recover gradually from 2021 onward, and grow at Japan’s potential growth rate of about 0.5 percent.",FALSE,normal

The FPAS model’s median projection for CPI headline and CPI core inflation is expected to rise gradually over the medium-term, but remain below the Bank of Japan (BoJ) target over the forecast horizon. Headline and core inflation will reach about 1.5 percent over the medium-term. Demand recovery, with support from an accommodative monetary policy stance and (already) tight labor market conditions, contribute to a gradual rise in inflation. However, mostly backward-looking inflation expectations and limited scope for monetary policy to quickly re-anchor expectations at the 2 percent target will prevent inflation from reaching the BoJ’s objective in the medium-term. Over time, inflation expectations are expected to become more forward-looking, provided there is a continuation of supportive monetary policy.",FALSE,normal

By the end of 2023, the likelihood that both CPI inflation measures will reach the BoJ’s 2 percent target is about 28 percent, while the likelihood that Japan will return to deflation (CPI inflation below zero) by 2020 is only about 21 percent. For GDP growth, the path fluctuates in 2019 and 2020, because of the consumption tax increase, and the likelihood that GDP growth will exceed 1 percent by the end of 2023 is about 25 percent.

Real output growth rates are reduced by one half of the 10-year historical standard deviation of changes in growth, for 2 consecutive years, starting in 2019. As a result, the primary balance deteriorates, leading to higher interest rates as in the primary balance shock scenario. Also, a decline in inflation is assumed at a rate of 0.25 percentage point per 1-point decrease in growth. The impact is significant, bringing the debt ratio to about 246 percent of GDP—around 9 percentage points higher than the baseline.

Although increasing only gradually due to the weighted average of JGB maturity at around 7.8 years,4 the effective interest rate is higher by more than 1 percentage point in 2023 when compared to the baseline, with the debt-to-GDP ratio higher by around 9 percentage points. The difference compared to the baseline does not appear large in the medium-term, but the impact will accelerate as the interest rate hike becomes fully reflected.

This reflects rising age-related expenditures and gradual increases in the interest-growth differential. As one of the most important risks, the current favorable interest-growth differential hinges largely on domestic investors’ home bias with high domestic saving, as well as large JGB purchases by the BoJ. This could be tested over time in the absence of a credible fiscal policy framework including a concrete medium-term fiscal consolidation plan.",FALSE,normal

As discussed in the main text, staff recommends maintaining a neutral fiscal stance in 2019 and 2020 and starting gradual adjustment from 2021 with annual consolidation of about 0.5 percent of GDP in the structural primary balance. This will stabilize public debt at the current level by 2030.

79,8,CA Assessment: 2018 projections,FALSE,normal
79,9,"Background. In line with growing national savings, the CA surplus has risen since 2013, reaching 4 percent of GDP in 2017, driven mainly by an improvement in the trade balance which was largely underpinned by lower energy prices. In 2017, the CA surplus increased by 0.1 percent of GDP relative to 2016, due to an improvement in the income balance, as the fall in the goods balance was offset by a higher services balance. The CA surplus is expected to shrink in 2018 to 3.6 percent of GDP, reflecting smaller income and goods trade balances. Japan’s CA is positive because of high corporate saving in excess of domestic investment opportunities, and a sizable income account owing to its large NFA position. The income balance continues to account for most of the current account surplus (90 percent in 2017 and over 95 percent in the first half of 2018). Assessment. The 2017 CA assessment uses the EBA model, where the estimated cyclically-adjusted CA of 3.6 percent of GDP is adjusted upward by 0.1 percent to reflect temporary factors (elevated energy imports with the nuclear power plant shutdown). EBA estimates the 2017 cyclically-adjusted CA norm at 3.2 percent of GDP, with a standard error of 1.3 percent of GDP. Staff estimates a 2017 CA norm range between 1.9 and 4.5 percent of GDP. The underlying 2017 CA gap midpoint is therefore assessed to be 0.5 percent of GDP (with CA gap range between -0.8 and 1.8), delivering that the 2017 CA is in line with the CA level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. Using 2018 projections, the EBA model estimates the 2018 cyclically-adjusted CA norm at 3.3 percent of GDP, with a standard error of 1.2 percent of GDP. Staff estimates a 2018 CA norm range between 2.0 and 4.5 percent of GDP. The projected CA gap midpoint in 2018 is therefore assessed to be 0.2 percent of GDP (with CA gap range between -1.1 and 1.4), preliminarily delivering that the projected 2018 CA is in line with the CA level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. However, the large unexplained portion of the EBA CA gap suggests that important bottlenecks to investment and consumption remain. Projected CA 3.6 Cycl. Adj.

79,10,Real exchange rate,FALSE,normal
79,11,"Background. After depreciating substantially during 2013-15, the average real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated substantially during 2016. In 2017, the average REER weakened by 4.9 percent relative to 2016, reflecting a significant nominal yen depreciation at the end of 2016 related in part to rising global interest rates following the U.S. election. Estimates through September 2018, show that the REER has depreciated by 0.2 percent relative to the 2017 average while it has appreciated by 2.9 percent relative to end-2017. Assessment. The EBA REER Index and Level models estimate the 2017 average REER to be 17-18 percent lower than the level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies, mainly from a large unexplained residual. Because of absent Japan-specific factors in the model, less weight is given to the EBA REER models. Using the staff-assessed 2017 CA gap range as reference and a staff- estimated semi-elasticity of 0.14 yields an indicative range for the 2017 REER gap as -13 to 6 percent with a midpoint of -4 percent. Taking into consideration that this broad REER gap range is due to the low semi-elasticity, the 2017 REER is assessed as in line with the level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. Following a parallel method using the projected 2018 CA gap range, the 2018 REER is preliminary assessed as in line with the level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies.",FALSE,normal

Net short yen positions have prevailed since Q2 2017, but after end-March net positions are balanced. Assessment. Vulnerabilities are limited (inward investment tends to be equity-based and home bias of Japanese investors remains strong). So far there have been no large spillovers from Yield Curve Control to financial conditions in other economies (interest rates, credit growth). If outflows from Japan accelerate, they could provide an offset to tighter domestic financial conditions in the region due to normalization of policy rates in other advanced economies.",FALSE,normal

85,4,"1. On November 14, Japan’s Cabinet Office released its preliminary estimate of real GDP growth for the third quarter (July–September) at -1.2 percent (annualized), down from 3.0 percent in the second quarter. The decline in GDP can be attributed largely to several natural disasters affecting Japan, including typhoons in the Osaka area, and an earthquake in Hokkaido. With protracted closures of several important shipment hubs, the typhoon disrupted supply chains, affecting both private investment and exports. Private consumption also contracted, due partly to a disaster-driven surge in fresh food prices. On December 10 the revised preliminary estimate for third quarter growth will be released. Headline CPI inflation continues to increase gradually, recording 1.2 percent (year-on-year) in September, supported by energy and food prices. However, price pressures from domestic demand remain subdued, with core CPI inflation (excluding fresh food and energy) remaining flat at 0.4 percent.",FALSE,normal
85,5,"2. Responding to the string of natural disasters, Japan’s Diet passed a supplementary budget on November 7.

Staff expects that the supplementary budget will have an effect next year, supporting 2019 growth.",FALSE,normal
85,6,"3. After declining in the second quarter, the external current account (CA) surplus recovered in the third quarter, with a balance (about US$50 billion) equal to the average CA balance over the first half of 2018. The main driver was a larger income balance, due to lower income debits. Meanwhile the trade balance turned to deficit, mostly due to increased goods imports and lower exports—the latter caused by the typhoon-related closure of Kansai International Airport and the Hokkaido earthquake that together disrupted export and tourism receipts. The yen has appreciated (in real effective terms) by almost 2 percent as of September 2018, relative to end-2017. Since the beginning of 2018, equity markets have fallen by 4.2 percent, and the 10-year government bond yield has increased by 7 basis points to 0.11 percent.",FALSE,normal

87,9,"8. Growth strategy, including structural reforms, is the central part of Abenomics. The GOJ has speedily implemented many structural reforms, including “bedrock regulation” reforms. Staff assesses that gaps remain and implementation has been slow while the GOJ has appropriately specified reform areas. The GOJ has conducted a wide range of important reforms, including the “work-style reform,” greater labor participation of female and older workers, acceptance of highly-skilled foreign professionals, corporate governance reforms, and trade liberalization and FDI promotion under the current administration. Thus, the GOJ does not think implementation has been slow while it will further accelerate structural reforms going forward.",FALSE,normal

The GOJ will further promote structural reforms to boost productivity and raise potential growth for mitigating constraints on economic growth from demographic changes. Furthermore, the fruits of the economic recovery have been brought to a full range of society. The Box.3 quantifies macroeconomic effects of demographic changes on the",FALSE,normal

The results clearly illustrate the importance of full implementation of structural reforms, especially labor market reforms. As we mentioned above, the GOJ specified a set of reform agenda in the Basic Policy 2018 with the subtitle of “Realizing Sustainable Economic Growth by Overcoming the Decreasing Birth Rate and Aging Population” as well as the Growth Strategy 2018 in this June. While we explain the specific reform agenda in the next three paragraphs, their basic concept is the followings: Under the adverse demographic changes, reforms to strengthen the supply side are the most critical to raise potential growth by reducing constraints on economic growth. On the labor force, the GOJ will promote investment in human resources by greater labor participation of female and older workers and free early childhood education (“human resources development revolution”). On the productivity, the GOJ will take measures to enhance productivity, including promotion of AI and robots which the Selected Issues mentions, and strengthening corporate-governance (“realization and expansion of Supply System Innovation”). The work-style reform remains essential. Moreover, it is imperative to spread the fruits of economic growth from urban to rural, and from large companies to SMEs.",FALSE,normal
88,4,"10. In particular, as staff gives them a top priority, labor market reforms are critically important. The GOJ will implement necessary reforms steadily. First and foremost, the GOJ continues to promote the “work-style reform.” The Work Style Reform Bills have been enacted in this June. Those bills include several clauses to rectify problems of work-style and labor market in Japan, including the establishment of a limit on overtime work with introduction of penalty in case of breach and the elimination of the irrational gap of the working conditions between regular and non- regular workers (“equal pay for equal work”). The GOJ will ensure effective implementation of the bills, for example, by developing a guideline and takes note the staff’s other recommendations, such as strengthening a training to non-regular workers and introducing job descriptions, which would complement the bills. The GOJ will make continuous efforts to enhance labor supply of female and older workers based on the Basic Policy 2018.",FALSE,normal
88,5,"11. The GOJ will continue to implement product market and corporate reforms, which are staff’s second priority. As we mentioned above, the GOJ will take measures to enhance productivity. Specifically, their priority areas include promoting the use of new technologies, such as AI, robots, and IoT, supporting smooth business successions, developing a guidance for corporate governance, and promoting the Regulatory Sandboxes System.",FALSE,normal
88,6,"12. The GOJ will further promote open and rule-based, multilateral trade and investment system, which is in line with staff’s third priority. Keeping and improving the trade system based on free and fair rules are the source of growth for the global economy. As Japan achieved rapid economic growth through free trade after WWII, the GOJ commits to take a leading role to promote free and fair rules of trade",FALSE,normal

In this regard, by proceeding with negotiations in mega agreements, including TPP11, Japan-EU EPA, and RECEP, the GOJ contributes to expand open and rule-based market in the global economy. TPP11 is scheduled to enter in force in this December, and Japan and EU reached an agreement in principle for Japan-EU EPA in this July.",FALSE,normal

The GOJ firmly maintains the basic principle ""without economic revitalization, there can be no fiscal consolidation,"" under the New Plan to Advance Economic and Fiscal Revitalization formulated in this June. The GOJ will accelerate and expand the three pillars reform, overcoming deflation and revitalizing the economy, expenditure reforms, and revenue reforms.",FALSE,normal
89,6,"14. For fiscal consolidation, the GOJ aimed to achieve the primary surplus of the central and local governments by FY 2020 and steady reduction on the debt to GDP ratio under the Plan to Advance Economic and Fiscal Revitalization developed in 2015. On the expenditures side, the GOJ formulated budgets in line with the benchmarks for general expenditures as set in the plan. On the revenue side, it is expected that central and local tax revenue for FY 2018 would record at high levels. However, improvements of the primary balance have been delayed compared to the initial assumptions because of a more moderate growth of tax revenues, as well as the impact of the postponement of the consumption tax rate from 8% to 10%. In addition, the GOJ decided to change the use of revenues from the consumption tax rate hike to preserve stable financial resources for the “human resources development revolution” mentioned above. Against this backdrop, it became difficult to achieve the target of the primary surplus by FY 2020. Also, while the rise in the public debt to GDP ratio has been moderate, it has not yet reached the point of steady reduction.",FALSE,normal
89,7,"15. Therefore, based on the developments mentioned above, the GOJ now aims for the primary surplus of the central and local governments by FY 2025 which would be more realistic while firmly maintaining the aim to achieve steady reduction on the debt to GDP ratio under the New Plan to Advance Economic and Fiscal Revitalization formulated in this June. To achieve the new fiscal consolidation target, the GOJ considers it imperative to put social security reforms as a center of consideration. In this vein, staff emphasizes the importance of specification of fiscal consolidation measures to enhance the credibility of the target. In this regard, the GOJ will comprehensively review progress focusing mainly on the social security reforms in FY 2020 and specify policy measures in social security, including modalities to balance between benefits and burdens. It should be noted that the GOJ will start to take actions, including scheduling and implementation of reforms, within FY 2019 – FY 2021.

90,4,"16. The consumption tax rate is scheduled to be increased from 8% to 10% on October 1, 2019 as stipulated by law. Based on our previous experience with the 3% consumption tax rate increase in 2014, we will mobilize a wide range of measures and make every effort to contain demand fluctuations before and after the tax rate increase, along with supports for low-income households. To this end, the GOJ will take temporal and special measures in the initial budgets for FY 2019 and FY 2020. The consumption tax rate hike is necessary to preserve stable financing sources for establishing a social security system for all generations. The GOJ has already announced the introduction of reduced tax rate, the enhanced relief of long-term care insurance premiums for the low-income elderly, and the provision of supporting benefits for pensioners to ease low-income households’ burden, as well as the provision of greater supports for child-rearing generations by modifying use of the revenues generated by the consumption tax rate hike. Furthermore, while the upcoming hike is 2% which is smaller than the last one, the GOJ will take adequate measures to contain demand fluctuation before and after the tax increase. Related to this point, the GOJ will take tax and budgetary measures to create advantages for purchases of consumer durable goods, including automobiles and housing, after October 1, 2019. The staff report pointed out that mitigating measures are yet to be fully specified. The GOJ will take temporary and special measures in the initial budgets for FY 2019 and FY 2020. Because the GOJ usually decides the Draft of initial budget in December each year, the GOJ will specify and show specific mitigating measures for FY 2019 soon. In addition, while staff mentions that our growth projections do not provide guidance on the size of mitigating measures to offset the impacts of consumption tax rate increases, specific size and items of mitigating measures will be determined in the process of formulating budgets. Finally, as staff recommends, the GOJ will clearly communicate with public on the necessity of the consumption tax rate hike and mitigating measures.",FALSE,normal

In addition, the BOJ decided to conduct market operations and asset purchases in a more flexible manner in order to enhance the sustainability of QQE with Yield Curve Control. For example, while the target level of the long-term yields was maintained at around zero percent, the BOJ made it clear that the actual yields might move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices. The policy is in line with staff’s recommendation that monetary policy should remain accommodative while putting a premium on policy sustainability. In fact, since the policy decision was made, the degree of market functioning has improved with the BOJ conducting JGB purchases in a flexible manner.",FALSE,normal

Related to this point, we would like to emphasize that progress in implementation of FSAP recommendations including on macroprudential policies and resolution has been made. Although staff mentions that “implementation of other main FSAP recommendations – particularly on macroprudential policies and resolution – is incomplete” in paragraph 5, we reiterate that progress in macroprudential policies and resolution has been made based on the FSAP recommendations as mentioned in paragraph 28. For example, the authorities have expanded the coverage of their intensive monitoring of stress testing exercise to some D-SIBs and other large banks in addition to Japanese G-SIBs (three megabanks) for systemic risk assessment and expanded the scope of the requirements on Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirement to one D-SIB.",FALSE,normal

We welcome the fact that staff does not apply the adjustor related to increased energy imports due to shut downs of nuclear power reactors for the preliminary 2018 CA external assessment.

92,7,"23. The authorities are still concerned about REER assessment using the CA gap calculated from the EBA methodology. First of all, exchange rates are determined by capital transactions rather than trade balance. Given the sensitiveness of capital transactions to interest rate differentials, it is extremely difficult to identify the appropriate level of REER. Linking CA assessment with REER assessment automatically causes a more fundamental problem especially in a country where income balance dominates in CA balances. Furthermore, developments of global value chains have also weakened the linkage between trade balance and REER.",FALSE,normal
92,8,"Being mindful of these limitations, the Fund should not pursue to identify the appropriate level of REER for free-floating currencies, especially in the case of income balances dominating in CA balances, like Japanese yen.
