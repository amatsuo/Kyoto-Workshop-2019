Strong global demand has boosted export-oriented manufacturing production, while increasing tourist arrivals have benefited several service sectors. Going forward, the Thai economy is expected to maintain its strong momentum, and is projected to expand at 4.2 percent in 2018, with growth moderating slightly to 4.0 percent in 2019.

4,12,"4. Overall fiscal policy remains expansionary in support of the economy. The overall fiscal deficit widened by 0.8 percentage points in 2017 to 3.6 percent of GDP, mainly on account of a fall in revenue, and despite the decline in expenditure. In FY2018, fiscal revenue and expenditure are budgeted to decline to 15.2 percent and 18.5 percent of GDP respectively, with the overall fiscal deficit at 3.3 percent of GDP, slightly lower than in FY2017.

A further escalation of trade conflicts, in particular between the U.S. and China, would be a downside risk to Thai exports reflecting its linkages to the regional supply chain.

5,8,"8. Fiscal policy should be directed towards infrastructure investment and structural reforms in order to lift growth potential and enhance the social security system to prepare for an aging population. The government’s thrust for mega-infrastructure projects is a welcome development and these projects should be expedited and executed in a timely and well-coordinated manner. Project planning, budgeting, and execution, could be done in a more coordinated manner in order to enhance the efficiency of public investment projects. To support the infrastructure drive and expansionary fiscal policy, it is important to improve the buoyancy of the tax system. Therefore, efforts to broaden the tax base and improve tax administration are needed in order to raise the tax revenue ratio and maintain fiscal sustainability.",FALSE,normal

5,10,"9. The current monetary policy stance is appropriate in supporting growth and financial stability. While inflation is still low, it is gaining traction, and is expected to move to within the target band. Given the ample liquidity in the financial system, a reduction in the policy rate will not be effective in boosting domestic demand but may increase household borrowing. Maintaining financial stability in a prolonged period of low interest rate environment requires a set of well-calibrated and coordinated policy instruments that include monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, and coordination with other regulatory agencies.",FALSE,normal

The Thai economy continues to gain traction, with growth increasing from 3.3 percent in 2016 to 3.9 percent in 2017 and 4.8 percent in Q1 2018, mainly driven by strong exports and tourism (Figure 1). Private consumption has been partly boosted by the end of the five-year lock-in period under the first-time car buyer scheme.1 Overall, however, the recovery in household consumption remains gradual as labor income growth, particularly of low-income households, has been moderate (see Appendix Figure 1.1). In addition, household debt is high,2 and the aging population is a drag on private consumption (see Selected Issue 1: Key Determinants of Thailand’s Private Consumption Growth).3 Private investment (see Figure 2), though still soft in 2017, is showing brighter prospects, as indicated by an increase in capacity utilization and capital goods imports (Appendix Figure 1.1). Public consumption and investment growth has been inching up but remain soft. Meanwhile, merchandise exports and tourist arrivals have rebounded strongly in 2017 and early 2018, while imports grew strongly (Figure 7; Appendix Figure 1.2).",FALSE,normal

Favorable weather, meanwhile, has spurred the recovery in agricultural output, Box A: Alternative Approach to Estimating the Net Contribution of Key Demand Components to GDP Growth in Thailand Similar to other emerging ASEAN economies, Thailand has achieved high economic growth, underpinned by rapid industrialisation and integration into the global economy, particularly in the 1970-90s and 2000s with sustained average annual real GDP growth of above 7 percent.4 Since the global financial crisis (GFC) in 2008/09, Thailand’s economic growth has been marked by fits and starts, reflecting small but frequent cyclical surges and retractions in economic activity. These developments reflect the more uncertain global landscape post-2008/09, as well as domestic factors (such as the 2011 flooding, domestic political conflicts in 2013/14, and the passing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016). As a result, real GDP growth had slowed to 3 percent annually on average, since 2012 (Figure A1). In the era of ‘new normal’, it is important to examine the drivers of economic growth over time, particularly the sources of demand in an open economy such as Thailand in order to gauge the structural changes taking place that will, in turn, have implications for future economic growth. In determining the drivers (or sources) of growth, conventional methods often use private consumption, public consumption, gross fixed capital formation (investment) and net exports as a share to GDP. The advantage of this method is the fact that net exports highlight the net contribution of foreign trade to economic growth. The limitation of this simple method is that it is not representative of the true relative contribution of domestic and external demand in driving growth. This is because imports that satisfy domestic demand are not netted out from each demand components, thereby overstating total domestic value-added. In this context, this Box looks at an alternative approach to estimating the net contribution of key demand components to GDP growth in Thailand (known as the ‘Import-adjusted’ Method), in order to identify the main drivers underlying the structural changes in growth dynamics observed in the Thai economy over the past several decades.",FALSE,normal

8,7," First, the contribution of external demand to value-added creation in the Thai economy rose to a peak in 2000–2010 and has since declined to 34 percent in 2017. The share of exports (net of imports) in total value-added increased sharply from 30 percent in 1995, just before the Asian financial crisis, to a peak of around 40 percent in 2000-2010 reflecting the boom in the regional supply chain. External demand share fell markedly to an estimated 34 percent in 2017 reflecting the collapse in global trade in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis and the European Sovereign Debt Crisis (ESDC). Considering Thailand’s export dependency, export- oriented firms (or SMEs with large exposure to the export sector), could likely see a slower growth in the period ahead (Figure A3). There could be additional headwinds to the Thai export sector, stemming from the current global trade tensions amid rising protectionist threats.",FALSE,normal
8,8," Second, partly reflecting the weak growth in disposable income, and to some extent, demographic headwinds from a rapidly aging population, private consumption (net of imports) has seen much slower growth in recent decade. In terms of GDP, it accounts for an estimated 33 percent share of GDP (down from 37 percent in 1995-2000). This is consistent with the findings that the five-year average propensity to consume of Thailand has declined to 0.65 in 2011-2015, against 0.83 in 2001-2005 (see Selected Issue 1). In contrast, public consumption (net of imports) has helped to support growth in recent years.",FALSE,normal
8,9," Third, fixed investment (net of imports) fell sharply from 21 percent in 1995, just before the AFC, to about 10.5 percent in 2000-2010 and has stayed relatively sluggish in recent years, increasing by only 2 percentage points from 2010 to 2017. While domestic considerations such as political uncertainty had play a large part in dampening private investment and domestic capacity utilization, the collapse in external demand and global trade in the wake of the GFC and ESDC, had reinforced the structural weakness.",FALSE,normal

Recognising the challenges ahead, it is encouraging to note that various strategies have been adopted to boost Thailand’s future growth, such as the mega projects initiatives: the North Eastern Railway, Eastern Economic Corridor and the 4th Industrial Revolution. The mega projects, in particular, would help to improve physical infrastructure, while promoting connectivity and crowding in private investment. The rebalancing of growth towards domestic sources will be critical at a time when the external environment is turning less supportive, including downside risks to exports.

Headline inflation was 0.7 percent in 2017, below the BOT’s medium-term inflation target of 2.5 ± 1.5 percent. The main contributing factor to low inflation in 2017 was the falling fresh food prices, while weak domestic demand dampened 2017 inflation to some extent.7 Mainly driven by higher oil prices, headline inflation rose to 1.1 percent yoy in April 2018, the first time it has been back in BOT’s target range since February 2017, and it has been in BOT’s target band since then (Figure 5). However, on a twelve-month moving average basis, inflation is around 0.82 percent, still below the lower end of the band. Core inflation has also been generally inching up since its trough in mid-2017, to reach 0.83 percent in June 2018. Based on BOT’s survey, the median inflation expectation by firms for the next 12 months falls within the BOT’s inflation target range, but below the midpoint (Figure 6).

11,7,"7. The current account surplus continued to be large, supported by an export upturn and buoyant tourism (Figures 7 and 8). Goods exports to most major trading partners such as ASEAN, the U.S., China, and Japan, grew strongly. The growth was across most major products such as automotives, electrical and electronic (E&E) products, and other manufacturing products. The robust growth in tourist arrivals (Appendix Figure 1.2) also resulted in higher services export growth (Figure 8) (see Selected Issue 2: Why has Thailand’s Tourism Industry Been Successful?). Nonetheless, the current account surplus narrowed slightly to 11.2 percent of GDP in 2017, primarily reflecting a significant increase in imports of raw materials and intermediate goods. Driven by the increase in oil prices and the pickup in exports, investment and consumption, imports have been recovering since September 2016, with raw materials and intermediate goods imports registering strong growth, although consumer goods and capital goods imports also broadly increased.

The protracted economic slowdown in 2013-2014 and the subsequent slow recovery have led to a deterioration in loan quality, particularly among SMEs and low-income households, although some signs of stabilization have appeared recently. Banks’ overall non- performing loans (NPL) ratio stood at 2.93 percent in Q2 2018, roughly the same in Q4 2017. A strong capital buffer and high loan-loss reserves will help shield commercial banks and state-owned specialized financial institutions (SFIs) from credit risks. Commercial banks’ liquidity coverage ratio stood at 177.6 percent on an aggregate basis as of June 2018, comfortably higher than the minimum requirement.9 However, banks’ return on assets and return on equity have been declining from 2014 to 2017, but slightly increased in the first half of 2018 due to lower provisioning expenses in line with stabilizing loan quality. Regulatory reforms, including the transfer of regulatory mandate of SFIs to the BOT, will result in SFIs being subject to comparable supervision as commercial banks, and help improve the financial soundness of SFIs. Other measures recently adopted to enhance financial stability are the issuance of the systematically important domestic banks regulation and the issuance of revised regulations on credit cards and household loans.

The possible impacts of this on Thailand are multi-faceted (see Box B. Quantifying the Impact of U.S.-China Trade Conflict on Thailand’s Real Sector). On the one hand, Thailand’s exports have diversified over the years (Figure 19), and that should soften the potential negative effects of the U.S.-China trade conflict. Also, there are Thai industries that may benefit from the U.S.-China trade conflict as the U.S. and China import more substitute products from Thailand (trade diversion). Likewise, some Chinese (or U.S.) firms could potentially relocate their production to Thailand as a way to get around the additional tariffs on domestic exports (investment diversion). However, there are also potential trade destruction effects which could adversely affect other Thai industries supplying intermediate goods or those that are part of the global value chain. In addition, there could be an overall reduction in imports from the U.S. and China resulting from lower GDP in those economies as a result of the trade war. These trade destruction effects could pose downside risks to Thai exports, in addition to a possible downturn in the export cycle as signaled by the recent moderation in export growth (Figure 20).",FALSE,normal

17,9,"Box B: Quantifying the Impact of US-China Trade Conflict on Thailand’s Real Sector Recently, trade conflicts between the US and China have escalated. The U.S. imposed additional tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, steel and aluminum, and on USD50 billion worth of Chinese products, sparking retaliation from China as well as the E.U., Canada and Mexico. In particular, China has retaliated with its own tariffs on USD50 billion worth of U.S. products. In turn, the U.S. has threatened tariffs on European cars, and on an additional USD200 billion of Chinese goods if China slaps further tariffs on U.S. products.15 The possible impacts of all these in Thailand are multi-faceted. On the one hand, there are potential trade destruction effects which could affect other Thai industries supplying intermediate goods or those that are part of the global value chain, in addition to the reduction in imports from US and China resulting from the their lower GDP as a result of the trade war. On the other hand, there are Thai industries that may benefit from the trade conflict, as for instance when US and China import more substitute products on their respective tariff lists from Thailand (trade diversion effect). Likewise, some Chinese (or U.S.) firms can potentially relocate their production to Thailand as a way to bypass the tariffs on exports (investment diversion effect). In this Box, we attempt to quantity the impact of the US imposing 25 percent tariff on 1,333 products from China covering USD46.4 billion worth of goods. The products are listed in the Office of the United States Trade Representative website, alongside the products’ 8-digit harmonized code.16 We aggregate the product list into their 2-digit classification product group and analyze the impact of US tariffs on different Thai sectors and economy as a whole, using the international input output table. In our analysis, we assume that due to the US tariffs, China will lose 30 percent of its exports to the US of the products subject to tariffs, and the production of these products are distributed pro-rata to Thailand, and other countries (including the U.S.) in proportion to their existing supply share to the U.S. The potential winners are Thai industries that export final products to the US in competition with China, while the potential losers are Thai industries that export intermediate goods to China for products destined to the US. Thus, according to our preliminary results, industries such as motor vehicle, other transport equipment, and machinery and equipment exporters will experience positive impact, while industries such as chemical and rubber products will experience negative effects. Overall, among the product groups in the US tariff list, Thai intermediate inputs to Chinese exports to the US are more substantial than what they potentially may (additionally) export directly to the U.S., given that Thailand’s relative production share in those product groups is small relative to other countries’. In addition, other Thai industries not in the US tariff list (such as agriculture) also supply intermediate inputs to Chinese exports in the US tariff list.

First, we have assumed that China will lose 30 percent of its US exports of products in the tariff list. The magnitude of the net negative impact on Thailand will be proportionally lower if China’s US export market share erosion turns out to be lower, and conversely if the share erosion turns out to be bigger. Second, we have assumed that China will not be able to diversify its exports into other markets. If China diversifies to other countries (other than Thailand), then Thailand’s intermediate suppliers to China will benefit. But if a significant portion of China’s exports is redirected to Thailand, then the negative impact on Thailand’s net exports will be higher. Third, our calculations incorporate only direct first round effects associated with trade diversion and trade destruction. In particular, it does not incorporate the impact of Chinese companies relocating to Thailand to export to US (investment diversion effects) which will be positive for Thailand. It also does not incorporate the second round effects to intermediate suppliers of Thailand which will get a boost as a result of an increase in production in Thailand (from exporting to US in competition with China), in addition to the boost to Thai intermediate suppliers from Chinese companies relocating production to Thailand. It also does not incorporate the impact of the decrease in US and China GDP, which will lower Thai exports. Some mitigating measures. First, Thailand could make itself more attractive to Chinese producers looking to outsource their production. Thus Thailand could invite Chinese producers in the US product list to relocate to Thailand and make Thailand its production base to export to the U.S. Along these lines, policies to increase infrastructure quality, ease doing business, and enhance the investment climate overall will be steps in the right direction. Second, the government can help suppliers affected by the trade conflict to restructure. Thailand’s intermediate producers can diversify and supply more products to the US and other third country beneficiaries of China’s export market share loss. Along these lines, the government can support Thai companies’ outward direct investment efforts and diversification strategy. More broadly, the government can support Thai companies to diversify their export destinations and better respond to changing global environment.",FALSE,normal

19,6,"Box C: Moving to Thailand 4.0: An Innovation-driven Economy Thailand has been through at least four different stages of economic development from agricultural- to manufacturing-oriented. Starting from Thailand 1.0 period before 1960, the economy was mainly driven by agricultural production. During Thailand 2.0 period from 1960 to 1987, the economy focused on labour-intensive industries, such as clothing and garment production. After 1987, during Thailand 3.0, the country shifted into heavy industries. In this phase, the automobile and chemical industries were the most important drivers of the economy. While the Thailand 3.0 strategy has been successful in upgrading the country as a major manufacturing hub in ASEAN, Thailand has faced major challenges over time and appears to have fallen into three economic development traps, namely the imbalance trap, income inequality trap, and a middle-income trap. 17 An imbalance trap is when an economic system is characterized by disparities in several dimensions, such as economic, social, or environmental, between the rich and the poor as well as between the urban and provincial. The income inequality trap refers to an economic structure that keeps poor people poor and destitute across generations. As for the middle-income trap, Thailand appears stuck in a middle income level of development and its growth is too low to allow it to move up the value chain to a high income level such as Korea. These major concerns prompted the government to adopt a new strategy to transform the economy into Thailand 4.0, which envisages a digitally-oriented and innovation-driven economy, focusing on high-value-added manufacturing and services. Thailand 4.0 aims at overcoming the three development traps through new growth engines with high technology, innovation and a knowledge-driven society, which is expected to promote sustainable growth, reduce income inequality, and to elevate Thailand to high-income country status, in accordance with the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan for 2017-2021 as well as the 20-year National Strategy. As part of the Thailand 4.0 initiative, the government is developing the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) project as the prime driver for economic growth. This model is an enhancement of the previous Eastern Seaboard Development Program, which was launched in 1982 across the three provinces of Chonburi, Rayong and Chachoengsao. These comprise a collective area of 13,285 square kilometres. The Board of Investment (BOI) recently announced that the model will transform the eastern part of Thailand into a key investment, technology and transportation hub for the country and the ASEAN region. The implementation of EEC will be based on three pillars – an infrastructure upgrade, new industry development, and investment incentive and facilitation. First, physical infrastructure investment is designed to support transportation, logistics and public utilities. Physical infrastructure is divided into three modes of transportation: a) air transportation: U-Tapao Airport will be upgraded to an international airport and support the EEC’s logistics industry; b) sea ports: Laem Chabang deep- sea port will be expanded from being am import-export port to a transhipment port for distribution to CLMV countries; and c) land transport: the integration of the high-speed train and the airport link is designed to connect Don Muang, Suvarnnabhumi and U-Tapao airports. Second, in terms of new industry development, the EEC will promote 10 target industries, which are expected to become the new drivers of growth.",FALSE,normal

20,5,"Source: Thailand Board of Investment The 10 target industries are divided into two categories, the S-Curve and New S-Curve. The S- Curve industries are comprised of five existing groups of industries in which Thailand has high potential and that can be developed by adding value through advanced technologies. These include next-generation automotives, smart electronics, affluent medical and wellness tourism, agriculture and biotechnology, and food for the future. The second group is that of the New S-Curve industries, which will become significant long-term growth divers: robotics, aviation and logistics, biofuels and biochemical, digital, and medical hubs. Third, investment incentives and facilitation are divided into tax and non-tax related incentives. The government will offer the investors in the special economic zone more corporate and personal income tax privileges beyond the current BOI regulations – such as the exemption of import duty on machine and raw material and corporate income tax exemption of up to 15 years. Non-tax incentives will cover visa and work permit facilitation, infrastructure readiness, and ease of doing business. Significant strides have brought good opportunities for both Thai and international investors. Thailand serves as an economic hub in Asia by virtue of its strategic location in the heart of the AEC, benefiting production, trade, exports and logistics. The country borders Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, all of which are undergoing rapid growth. It is therefore one of the most suitable investment destinations for connecting Asia to the world. The EEC’s strategic location also makes it convenient for investors to import and export raw materials and finished goods to border countries – Cambodia, Lao, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. This is a great opportunity for Thailand to attract investment from foreign firms to invest in Thailand. It also involves the improvement and establishment of regional R&D centers. In the medium term, there are three challenges or concerns that need to be addressed for Thailand to achieve the potential presented by Thailand 4.0. The first is the inadequacy of a sufficiently highly-skilled workforce, especially of technology specialistsis; the second is the lack of quality infrastructure resulting in high administrative costs; and the third is the inadequacy of intellectual property right protections. Therefore, additional measures to strengthen labor capacity, such as an intensive vocational training, will need to be enhanced. In addition, the legislative and regulatory environment for property rights should be upgraded. References: Bhunai, P.

21,7,"19. Faster-than-expected U.S. Fed rate hikes could lead to capital flow volatility. Recently, there have been net outflows by non-residents in both the stock and bond markets (Figure 21), reflecting risk aversion towards emerging markets and concerns over the escalating trade conflicts between the U.S. and China. Also, the Thai baht has been on a depreciating trend since April 2018 (Figure 21), while bond yields have been increasing. The stock market index was declining since January before rebounding in July (Figure 14). However, non-resident bond outflows should not be a big cause of concern as foreigners hold only about 10 percent of government securities (Figure 22). Moreover, Thailand’s substantial international reserves, at 9.3 months of imports and 3.4 times of short-term debt as of June 2018, provide the economy with a strong cushion against the adverse impact of outflows. That said, capital flow volatility amid global uncertainty would warrant continued vigilance.",FALSE,normal

However, housing loans NPLs have continued to increase side by side with the rise in the percentage of new housing loans’ ratio with LTV above 90 percent, and the rise in median loan-to-income ratio. There is thus a need to monitor housing loans alongside developments in the real estate supply. NPLs in the SME sector remain elevated, although some signs of stabilization have appeared recently. Overall, however, although credit risk in the banking system warrants continued vigilance, commercial banks remain sound with a strong buffer from capital and loan-loss reserves. Meanwhile, following SFI reforms, which included the transfer of their supervision to the BOT in 2016, the SFIs’ NPL ratio has declined and is now closer to the NPL ratio of commercial banks (Figure 23).",FALSE,normal

Household savings in credit cooperatives and credit unions, together with investment in fixed income funds and foreign investment funds (see Figure 24), have expanded faster than household deposits at commercial banks and SFIs in the past five years. There is thus a need to continue close monitoring of the search-for-yield behavior and ensure that it does not lead to the underpricing of risks. There is also a need to reform the regulatory and supervisory framework of savings cooperatives, to ensure they adopt best practices and do not pose risks to the financial system. Toward this end, the authorities’ efforts to develop a savings cooperative plan and to draft the Cooperative Act are steps in the right direction.",FALSE,normal

The Bills of Exchange (B/E) defaults in late 2016 and the first half of 2017 have resulted in a greater proportion of higher-rated bond issuances and a smaller proportion of lower- or non-rated bond issuances. In late 2016 and the first half of 2017, there were defaults on several non-rated corporates’ B/Es. These B/Es represented only about 0.2 percent of total corporate bonds outstanding and did not result in systemic defaults in other B/Es. In the wake of the B/E defaults, the percentage of non-rated and lower-rated bonds issued fell and the percentage of higher-rated bond issuances increased, in large part due to investors’ becoming more aware of the risks associated with lower or non-rated B/Es. Thus, the share of bonds rated below BBB or non-rated fell to 4.8 percent in H1 2018 from 7.7 percent in 2016, while the share of bonds rated AA or higher increased to 79.2 percent from 76.2 percent (Figure 25).",FALSE,normal

On a positive note, the household debt-to-GDP ratio has declined from its peak of 80.8 percent in Q4 2015 to 77.6 percent in Q1 2018 (Figure 26). Nonetheless, deleveraging is taking place mainly in high-income households, and low- and medium-income households and farmers remain vulnerable, given their higher debt-to-financial asset ratio and weaker debt service capacity.18 To help ease the household debt problem, the BOT, together with commercial banks and Sukhumvit Asset Management Company, set up the Household Debt Clinic to facilitate the debt restructuring of distressed households.",FALSE,normal

24,5,"24. Thailand is aging at a relatively fast pace (Figure 27), with significant decline in the national fertility rate, and is at risk of “getting old before getting rich”. Based on UN population projections, the share of Thailand’s working age population is expected to fall by more than 10 ppts between now and 2040. The proportion of the working age population has been falling since 2011, at a faster rate than the regional average (Figure 27b). In addition, the labor force participation rate has been declining since 2013, while the dependency ratio (see Figure 27c) has been rising since 2012. Thailand’s aging will decrease the working age population, with a consequent reduction in the contribution of labor to Thailand’s potential growth. Aging has also contributed to the sluggish growth of household consumption in Thailand (see Selected Issue 1: Key Determinants of Thailand’s Private Consumption Growth). Population aging may also put pressures on the fiscal position, as pension and health-related spending will rise. And unlike other industrialized countries facing similar aging problem, Thailand is at risk of “getting old before getting rich” – which makes aging a relatively bigger challenge for Thailand’s policymakers.",FALSE,normal
24,6,"25. In addition, the shortage of skilled labor poses a challenge to growth, particularly as the country pursues the Thailand 4.0 initiative and endeavors to become a high- income country by 2026. Thailand’s 20-year national development strategy envisions it as a high income country by 2026, and that requires the economy to expand at an average rate of 5.0 percent a year.19 However, in addition to the potential shrinking of the labor force, Thai firms also face difficulty in hiring skilled labor, in particular engineers in both IT and non-IT fields, scientists, researchers, managers and salespersons with technical skills. This shortage will be a medium- to long-term challenge and warrants improvement in the quality of Thai education— especially in science and technology—which remains relatively poor compared to regional peers.

Overall, fiscal space remains significant with the public debt at a moderate level of 40.8 percent of GDP, well below the 60.0 percent ceiling (Figure 28).

The government’s thrust for mega-infrastructure projects is a welcome development, and should be expedited and executed in a timely and well-coordinated manner to crowd in private investment, which has been relatively subdued, and to enhance potential growth. The authorities’ efforts in pushing forward non-debt financing, including Public Private Partnerships and the Thailand Future Fund for mega-infrastructure projects, are commendable as they will help contain the fiscal deficit and growing public debt. The large current account surplus also gives considerable space to Thailand to pursue more structural measures such as increasing the investment rate, which has not recovered following the sharp drop after the Asian Financial Crisis (see Box A: Alternative Approach to Estimating the Net Contribution of Key Demand Components of GDP Growth in Thailand).",FALSE,normal

An integrated and well-formulated public investment program should help ensure that investments in mega-infrastructure projects will help crowd in private investment and enhance the growth potential over the medium and long term. This will also help increase the absorptive capacity for capital expenditure and SOE investment projects, which have been plagued by low disbursement rates (see Figure 29).",FALSE,normal
26,5,"29. To support the infrastructure drive and expansionary fiscal policy, it is important to improve the buoyancy of the tax system. The fiscal position could be pressured by the huge investment in infrastructure projects over the medium term and expanding medical expenses, as a result of aging population. Therefore, efforts to broaden the tax base and improve tax administration are needed in order to raise the tax revenue ratio and maintain fiscal sustainability as mandated by the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Accordingly, AMRO staff welcomes the government’s plan to raise fiscal revenue to around 20 percent of GDP, as well as the plan to improve tax administration through the use of technology by moving towards e-revenue, utilizing Promptpay, and using big data analytics and machine learning, among others.

They emphasize that the EEC project does not merely focus on physical infrastructure investment, but includes human capital investment as well, with the establishment of the Eastern Economic Corridor of Innovation (EECi) and the like. The authorities believe that the ramp up in infrastructure investment will not necessarily result in a significant increase in government expenditures, as the investment will also tap on alternative sources of financing such as the Thailand Future Fund and Public Private Partnerships. They are also of the view that the aging population will not necessary result in higher government spending, as they are encouraging the population to save for their post-retirement spending, such as through the National Savings Fund launched in 2015 and the National Pension Fund, which is in the process of being established.",FALSE,normal

27,5,C.2 Accommodative Monetary Policy is appropriately supportive of growth and financial stability,FALSE,normal
27,6,"32. The current monetary policy stance is appropriate in supporting growth and financial stability, and consistent with inflation moving in line with the inflation target. While growth is only slightly above potential of around 3.8 percent (Figure 30) and yet to be broad-based, it is gradually gaining momentum. While inflation is still low, it is also gaining traction, and is expected to continue to inch up to the target band. Given the ample liquidity in the financial system and the weak demand for credit (see Figure 31), as well as a relatively flat Phillips curve, a reduction in the policy rate will not be effective in boosting credit and domestic demand but may increase risk to financial stability. Maintaining financial stability in a prolonged period of low interest rate environment is challenging and requires a set of well-coordinated policies that include appropriate monetary policy, well calibrated macro- and micro-prudential regulations, and coordination with other regulatory agencies. The search-for-yield behavior associated with the low interest rate environment requires continued monitoring and should be supported by a financial literacy campaign, to ensure that retail investors are well-informed and do not take excessive risks. In particular, a continued search-for-higher-yield behavior through savings cooperatives, whose assets and deposits surged at a higher rate, has led to a need to reform the regulatory and supervisory framework of savings cooperatives, to ensure that they adopt best practices and do not pose risks to the financial system.",FALSE,normal

Along these lines, the efforts by the authorities to develop database for supervision of cooperative, formulate a savings cooperative plan, and to draft the Cooperative Act are commendable. Also, the tightened regulation on personal loans and credit cards, effective since 1 September 2017, and the Household Debt Clinic loan restructuring program, will help enhance credit quality relating to household loans, and help ease households’ financial burden.

Efforts to increase potential growth should be continued in order to achieve the goal of becoming a high-income country by 2026. Given the aging population, this would require higher contributions of labor productivity, total factor productivity and capital formation in order to counteract the declining contribution of labor input. Labor productivity can be increased by improving the quality of education, especially in science and technology, and expanding vocational training, while more resources can be devoted to research and development. To increase total factor productivity, Thailand needs to develop an ecosystem for innovation and entrepreneurship, increase R&D expenditure, increase its number of scientists and engineers, and enhance IP protection. In addition, a coordinated package of reforms is necessary in order to cope with the rapid pace of aging, including extending the retirement age, mobilizing previously untapped talents in the countryside, and encouraging high-skilled immigration.20 The multiplier effects of the EEC on other regions in the country should also be enhanced to promote inclusive growth and reduce inequality.

36,7,I. Introduction,FALSE,normal
36,8,"1. Thailand’s private consumption has grown slowly since 2014 as compared to 2001-2007. During the period of domestic political conflicts in 2013-2014, consumer confidence was dampened, and private consumption was subdued. Despite a gradual recovery since then, private consumption has remained relatively weak compared with the period after the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) in 1997 and the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 (Figure A1.1). Indeed, the five-year average propensity to consume21 for Thailand declined to 0.65 in 2011-2015 from 0.83 in 2001-2005. The share of private consumption to GDP in nominal terms also fell to 52.3 percent in 2011-2015 from 55.8 percent in 2001-2005. 22 Regionally, Thailand’s private consumption growth is outpaced by its peers (Figure A1.2).",FALSE,normal
36,9,"2. Aside from the psychological impact of political events and the national mourning after the passing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the sluggish consumption recovery could be explained by households’ weak financial position and demographic change. Household income declined, following a broad economic slowdown across all sectors in 2013- 2014 and owing to the severe drought in 2015-2016. At the same time, household debt rose rapidly by double digits after the first car purchase policy was introduced in 2011 in order to support the auto industry in the wake of the massive floods. Another possible reason for weak consumption would be the rapidly aging society, which causes the people to spend less and save more for retirement.",FALSE,normal
36,10,"3. This selected issue aims to study the key drivers of Thailand’s private consumption growth and underlying factors responsible for its slow recovery since 2014. The following analysis is composed of four sections. The first section sets up the consumption function based on the lifecycle consumption theory and intertemporal consumption decision. It follows Muellbauer (2007), Estrada et al (2014) and Vihriälä (2017), who estimated the relations between private consumption and household income, saving and investment decisions and interest rates. Considering the influence of aging, Estrada et al (2011) found that during the early stage of demographic transition, robust consumption may not be driven by an aging population since the government’s spending on healthcare and measures to stimulate consumption could be offset by an increase in household saving. The second section reviews and assesses the impact of aging on households’ consumption in the case of Thailand. As for household debt, Estrada et al (2014) showed that the deleveraging process after the GFC led to a 40 percent drop in consumption in the U.S., the U.K. and Spain. Kang (2017) found that increase in household debt (flow effect) stimulated private consumption in Korea, while the high level of household debt (stock effect) dampened private consumption and GDP. Inspired by these",FALSE,normal

37,5,"4. The relationship between households’ consumption behavior vis-à-vis disposable income and financial wealth are studied. According to the conventional theory of consumption, at each point of time, a household makes an intertemporal consumption decision depending on its lifetime income and net asset value. The baseline model in this study follows Muellbauer (2007), Estrada (2014) and Vihriälä (2017), whereby a change in household consumption is determined through current household earning, future income expectations, a change in net asset holding and real interest rate, as shown in equation [1].

38,5,"6. Weakening disposable income and negative real interest rate partially explain sluggish private consumption, while financial wealth has held up consumption growth. In Figure A1.3 and Table A1.1, the result of the baseline model indicates that disposable income, households’ accumulation of financial assets and real interest rate are key drivers of Thailand’s private consumption. A one ppt increase in disposable income could lead to 0.25 ppts increase in private consumption. As Thailand’s disposable income softened during 2012-2016 due to a prolonged period of slow economic recovery and severe drought in 2015-2016, it would have translated into sluggish private consumption. Meanwhile, a change in income expectations is unlikely to have a significant influence on Thai households’ consumption. With regard to real interest rates, a change in real interest rates has a negative influence on the growth of overall private consumption through two channels. First, for net saving households, an increase in real interest rates leads them to accumulate more financial assets and thus reduce consumption. Second, for net borrowing households, an increase in interest rates lends to tighter financial liquidity, which accordingly leads to a decline in consumption by them. Figure A1.3.

Based on the experiences of other countries during 2011-2015, Figure A1.4 shows that the aging population was a drag on private consumption.

39,5,"8. Although population aging in Thailand is not as serious as it is among its regional peers, a rapidly aging population has contributed to weaker expansion of private consumption. The share of the senior population increased from approximately 4.0 percent in 1970 to 11.0 percent in 2016. Thailand’s old-age dependency ratio was 15.3 percent in 2016, compared with 39.6 percent in Japan, 19.1 percent in Hong Kong, 17.9 percent in Singapore and 16.4 percent in Korea. In line with cross-country analysis, the result from Model [2] in Table A1.1 shows that a rising old-age dependency ratio is a negative driver of private consumption growth. Similarly, the result from Model [3] shows that the senior population has a smaller contribution to private consumption, compared with the working population. With an expanding senior population but declining working age population, overall private consumption growth is most likely to be softer than earlier. Figure A1.4.

39,6,"9. This study assesses the causality between rising indebtedness among Thai households and overall private consumption growth. Thailand’s household debt increased substantially in 2012, driven mainly by the first-car buyer incentive scheme. The household debt- to-GDP ratio rose from 59.3 percent in 2010 to an 80.8 percent peak in Q2 2015. Although it has since moderated, the debt level still remained high at 77.7 percent of GDP in Q1 2018. To analyze the relationship between household debt and private consumption, this study refers to Kang (2017), who pointed out that investigating the net effects of household debt on consumption and economic growth should be separated into flow effects and stock effects. The residuals of Model [2]25 with the old dependence ratio are regressed against a change in household borrowing at the start of and during the period (flow effect), and household debt level (stock effect) at the start of the period.",FALSE,normal

40,4,"10. Increasing household borrowing could support households’ consumption expenditure in the short term, but it remains unclear whether a high stock of household debt can weigh on consumption in the medium term. Table A1.2 shows an intertemporal effect of household borrowing on private consumption. An increase (decrease) in household borrowing led to an increase (decrease) in private consumption in the same period but resulted in a decrease (increase) in private consumption in the following period. This could imply that Thai households borrowed to finance daily expenses. The rise in debt in a preceding period would drag consumption spending in the current period. Meanwhile, relationship between a high debt stock, represented by household debt-to-GDP ratio, and private consumption growth was not strong based on the model results (Table A1.2). Panel data relating to household debt-to- GDP ratios and private consumption growth of regional peers, do not exhibit an explicit correlation either (Figure A1.6). On the contrary, when Thailand’s private consumption growth is plotted against the household debt-to-GDP ratio, a negative relationship exists (Figure A1.7). Table A1.2.

41,4,"slow growth of private consumption was explained by subdued economic activities in 2014-2015. Rising concerns over an aging population, an expanding senior population and declining working age population all contributed to the slow recovery in private consumption since 2014, compared with the periods after the AFC and GFC. Meanwhile, this study shows that Thai households rely on debt to finance their consumption expenditure but the dragging effects of high household indebtedness on private consumption growth, at the aggregate national level, remain unclear.",FALSE,normal
41,5,"12. Provided that micro-level data of Thai households is available, spending behavior of individual or grouped households could be assessed in order to study the impact of other possible drivers such as income inequality and debt service burden. Households’ spending behavior always varies across income levels. Similarly, a different level of debt and financial liquidity condition can also lead to different consumption patterns. Although this study did not find a strong relationship between high household debt stock and private consumption growth at the macro level, this relationship should be further explored at the individual household level. Considering the ongoing demographic change, an aging society does not always weigh on aggregate private consumption but does lead to a change in consumption behavior and structure. Therefore, to better understand the aging dynamic, more granular analysis separated by age level of households and products consumed should be undertaken.

According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, travel and tourism contributed 20.6 percent to Thailand’s GDP in 2016 (USD82.5 billion) and 15.1 percent of total employment (5,739,000 jobs). Its projections suggest that tourism will continue to play an important role in Thailand’s long-term growth, expanding by 6.5 percent per annum to contribute 31.7 percent of GDP in 2027 (USD169.9 billion) and increasing employment by 4.6 percent per annum to 9,599,000 jobs over the same period (24.9 percent of total employment).

UNWTO and ILO (2013) observed that international tourism demand from countries with strong links to European and North American tourists were the most negatively affected after the GFC. That said, according to Thailand’s Ministry of Tourism and Sports, in 2017 the European segment still contributes to more than 18.4 percent of tourism expenditure in Thailand, compared to around 27.7 percent from Chinese tourists.",FALSE,normal

44,9,"6. Tourism in Thailand has benefitted from both the demand and supply sides. It is known as a developed tourism market that is supported by its hospitality, infrastructure, affordable accommodation and variety of attractions, most notably its beautiful beaches, temples and palaces, historical sites, eco-attractions and cuisine. The lenient visa policies also makes Thailand an attractive destination for tourists who want to stay either short- or long- term. In addition, Thailand has likely benefitted from a relatively stable exchange rate. Previous research has shown that the exchange rate is the most significant determinant of the long-run tourism demand (Webber, 2001; Dweyer et al, 2002). Stronger exchange rates tend to be negatively correlated with international tourism arrivals.",FALSE,normal
44,10,NA,FALSE,empty
44,11,"7. Previous research suggests that an increase in the world GDP per capita, depreciation of the national currency, and declines in relative domestic prices help boost tourism demand. Martins et al (2017) examine the relationship between macroeconomic variables and tourism demand as measured by the number of tourist arrivals and their expenditure, using an unbalanced panel of 218 countries over the period 1995 - 2012. They find that world GDP per capita is more important in explaining arrivals, but relative prices are more important when expenditures are used as a proxy for tourism demand. Separately, Khadaker and Islam (2017) found that exchange rate played a vital role in tourism demand and an appreciation of a currency was negatively correlated with international tourism arrivals.",FALSE,normal

The results suggest that strong global demand and relatively good infrastructure have been the driving factors for the expansion of Thailand tourism and that there is significant potential for the Thai tourism sector to continue as a driver of economic activity in Thailand. Consistent with the literature, increases in origin countries’ real GDP per capita are important for tourist arrivals (Table A3.2). However, price competitiveness is not a significant driver of tourism in the model. This could be related to the fact that inflation has been quite subdued both in Thailand and globally, and Thai Baht exchange rate has been relatively stable. Improvements infrastructure, such as air transportation, has boosted the number of tourist arrivals but internet penetration has not played an important role.",FALSE,normal

ASEAN countries (the constant term in the regression) in the lower-income bracket have contributed significantly to the increase in tourist flows into Thailand but selected underserved groups offer potential for further growth. Specifically, tourists from South Asia (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) have fallen significantly by comparison, as have visitors from higher income countries. On the other hand, the growth in tourism from other regions is not significantly different from the growth in the number of tourists from their ASEAN counterparts.",FALSE,normal

47,18,"11. The significance of air transportation shows the importance of infrastructure in helping Thailand to become the next regional hub. Although the World Travel and Tourism Council (2017) shows that Thailand has better air service infrastructure compared to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, its international airport capacity and quality are still behind regional leaders, such as Hong Kong and Singapore26. This is important because 81.8 percent of total tourists into Thailand use air transportation, while 16.0 percent use land transport and 2.3 percent sea transport. The government should continue building and expanding airports and promoting land border as another important point of entry, especially to attract short-visit tourists from neighboring countries. Moreover, the future expansion could also consider potential travel segments that have yet to become popular such as river tourism. This expansion strategy on infrastructure would support their Secondary City Strategies (which includes 55 provinces that are now popular to foreigners) and attract business opportunities for foreign investors.",FALSE,normal

This gives an opportunity to Thai authorities to make improvements in areas where tourists spend most of their money and strengthen competitiveness in quality in terms of targeting more high value added tourism which will continue to grow.

Thailand has already positioned itself as the leader in the intraregional tourism sector, therefore it can differentiate the attractions that target high end segments such as cultural tourism, Sea Sun Sand tourism, and medical tourism, especially in second-tier cities and local community areas.
