5,6,"KEY ISSUES Context: A cyclical recovery is underway though it is yet to be broad-based. Domestic demand remains sluggish amid structural challenges, inflation continues to show weak dynamics, and the current account surplus remains large. The authorities have taken important measures to strengthen financial stability, and enacted reforms that bode well for medium-term fiscal management and credibility. Under the 12th National Development Plan, the government’s program aims to address the impediments to growth and scale up infrastructure to enhance Thailand’s position in global value chains and propel the economy into the digital age. Outlook: Staff expects the growth momentum to carry over into 2018 and 2019, with a moderate slowdown in the medium term. Exports would be the main growth engine in the next two years, while domestic demand is expected to recover in the medium term. Inflation is projected to remain below the 2.5 percent target throughout the projection period. Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced in the near term, but tilted to the downside in the medium term. Policy recommendations: Staff recommends an expansionary policy mix including fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, and structural reforms which would help steer the economy toward a more balanced growth path and external rebalancing. Specifically:",FALSE,normal
5,7,"• Thailand should use available fiscal space judiciously to spur domestic demand and support potential output. Staff supports implementation of macro-critical public infrastructure projects, which would also crowd in private investment.",FALSE,normal
5,8,"• Monetary easing would help steer inflation to target. It would complement the fiscal stimulus, curtail risks of low inflation, and help balance capital flows. FX intervention should be limited to avoiding disorderly market conditions.",FALSE,normal
5,9,• Macroprudential policy should ensure continued containment of systemic risks from search-for-yield behavior. This would provide monetary policy the necessary space to effectively target inflation.,FALSE,normal
5,10,"• Structural reforms would help address the challenges that currently hamper domestic demand and potential growth, and prepare the country for longer-term demographic challenges. Recommended policies include strengthening public investment implementation capacity, improving social safety nets, supporting labor force participation and education, and improving the business environment.",FALSE,normal

8,6,"1. Thailand’s economic outlook is improving. Growth is benefitting from stronger global and regional trade and greater clarity on the political transition. Trade in ASEAN+3 countries grew in dollars terms by 11.6 percent in 2017, and the outlook is for continued buoyant trade, although trade protectionism poses a downside risk. On the domestic side, the government indicated that national elections would now be held in early 2019, which should help reduce political uncertainty.",FALSE,normal
8,7,"2. Domestic demand remains sluggish reflecting structural challenges. Household debt is still high and weighs on consumption, particularly in the rural sector, which has been hit by weather shocks and a decline in commodity prices. Other structural factors may also be keeping growth from trickling down to household income: (i) the contraction in the working age population tends to reduce household income; (ii) automation in the manufacturing sectors can increase output without raising hours worked; and (iii) the ongoing structural transformation of the economy as services expand and manufacturing contracts may contribute to slow wage growth.",FALSE,normal
8,8,"3. Against this backdrop, discussions focused on a strategy to support domestic and external rebalancing and raise potential growth in the long run. During 2017, the fiscal stance was slightly contractionary, and monetary policy could have been more supportive (Appendix I). In the discussions, staff recommended an expansionary policy mix based on: (i) an infrastructure-driven fiscal stimulus to support domestic demand, including by drawing in private investment; (ii) monetary easing to help steer inflation back to target, with macroprudential policy geared to preserving financial stability; and (iii) structural reforms to address the long-term demographic challenges, increase productivity, and enhance inclusive growth.

Real GDP growth is estimated at 3.9 percent in 2017, boosted by strength in tourism services and manufacturing exports led by improving economic performance in the United States and the region. However, growth is not broad-based, with export gains failing to trickle down to household incomes and investment opportunities in other sectors.",FALSE,normal

Supply shocks, including global factors and low food prices owing to a strong harvest, partly explained the low headline inflation. Over the first quarter of 2018, despite the rebound in oil prices, headline inflation remained below the target band, partly reflecting low fresh food prices, but also persistently weak core",FALSE,normal

9,6,"6. The macro policy mix remained insufficiently supportive of external rebalancing. The monetary policy rate remained unchanged at 1.5 percent, despite sliding inflation expectations, keeping the (ex post) real interest rate above neutral rate estimates.1 The fiscal stance tightened somewhat—based on staff’s estimated structural balance—due to lower public investment, which was only partially offset by a decline in tax revenues. Part of the revenue decline is explained by a cut in the income tax in 2017, the impact of lower oil prices on oil tax revenues, and a reduction in import duties.",FALSE,normal
9,7,"7. The current account surplus remains excessive. Despite a modest decline, the surplus is estimated at 10.6 percent of GDP in 2017, reflecting buoyant exports of goods and services. In U.S. dollar terms, goods exports increased by 9.7 percent, following the improvement in trade partners’ economies. Rapid growth of tourism has been the main driver of service exports in recent years (see Appendix III). Visitors from Asia, especially China, accounted for the bulk of tourist arrivals, increasing to 72 percent of total visitors in 2017 from 60 percent in 2005. The capital and financial account registered a deficit of 4 percent of GDP. FDI outflows reached a historical high of 4.6 percent of GDP reflecting mainly Thai corporates' investment overseas. At about 30 percent of GDP in 2017, Thailand’s external debt is projected to remain relatively low over the medium term (Appendix V).",FALSE,normal

The sizable and continuous monthly increase in the stock of reserves and FX forward position during 2017 suggests that FX intervention has been mostly one-sided. Nevertheless, the REER appreciated at an increasing pace, resulting in 3.4 percent real effective appreciation in 2017 and a 9.6 percent nominal appreciation versus the U.S. dollar. The large current account surplus and sizable portfolio inflows were the main drivers of exchange rate appreciation pressures and reserve accumulation, only partially offset by net outflows in FDI and other investment.

10,6,"9. Staff expects the growth momentum to continue in 2018 and 2019, while domestic and external imbalances narrow only gradually. Export dynamism is expected to continue, while domestic demand remains sluggish, recovering only in the medium term. Fiscal policy is assumed to be supportive, with stimulus amounting to 1.4 percent of GDP over the medium term, resulting from a strong rebound in public investment in 2018 and partial implementation of the EEC projects starting in 2019 (see Box 1). The monetary policy rate is assumed to remain unchanged in the medium term. The current account balance is projected to decline only gradually over the medium term, as investor and consumer confidence solidify, and domestic private demand gathers speed. Inflation is expected to remain below the 2.5 percent target throughout the projection period, while the output gap is expected to close over the medium term.",FALSE,normal
10,7,"10. Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced in the near term, but tilted to the downside over the medium term. On the up side, the expansion in exports of goods and services, especially in tourism, could continue to exceed expectations. The impact of Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) projects could also surpass staff’s projections of implementation and crowding in of private investment. On the downside, protectionism could dampen the dynamism in international trade. The fiscal stance in FY 2019 may not be sufficiently supportive of activity, and private domestic demand could fail to pick up owing to the household debt overhang, stagnant household income, and low SME investment and productivity growth. Inflation may fail to rise even if domestic demand does, given the flatness in the Phillips Curve and lower inflation expectations. Medium-term external risks include negative spillovers from the U.S. tax reform as the fiscal stimulus unwinds starting in 2021, monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, and a bumpy rebalancing in China (see Appendix II).",FALSE,normal

They welcomed staff’s positive economic outlook, noting the strong external sector and gradual improvement in domestic demand. They argued, however, that staff’s medium-term projection of potential growth may not sufficiently capture the contribution from structural reforms and public investment. The authorities noted that planned investments included not only those in the EEC, but also infrastructure projects that were being rolled out nationwide. Improvements in productivity and business climate, as well as strengthened domestic demand, would be key drivers of growth going forward. At the same time, they recognized that many challenges in the Thai economy, especially in the labor market and the agricultural sector, needed to be addressed through structural reforms to promote higher and inclusive growth in the medium term.",FALSE,normal
11,8,"12. Thailand’s external position remains substantially higher than warranted by medium- term fundamentals and desirable policies. Based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA) model, and accounting for Thailand-specific factors, staff’s preliminary estimation suggests a cyclically adjusted current account (CA) gap of about 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent of GDP and an implied REER gap of -13 percent to -6 percent (see Figure 6, Appendices III and IV). With structural challenges likely to persist, reducing the CA gap will require a concerted policy effort to support domestic demand and sustained, albeit gradual, appreciation of the REER over the medium term.",FALSE,normal

They noted that savings from lower prices of imported oil contributed to the large external position, while aging population was not likely to translate the gains from the current account into new investment in a short time span. They found that the benefits from the recent boom in the tourism sector have not sufficiently trickled down into the broader economy, especially consumption and investment.

Structural reforms that support public investment, promote linkages between the dynamic export sector and other sectors of the economy, improve social safety nets, increase labor force participation and raise productivity in an increasingly digital economy, would spur household income and strengthen aggregate demand. This would help reduce the current account surplus over time and allow the needed real exchange rate appreciation to take place through a growth-driven process including higher inflation.

While the transmission mechanism may have weakened, guidance on the commitment to meet the inflation target would raise monetary policy effectiveness by strengthening the expectations channel. The flattening of the Phillips Curve suggests that economic recovery may take longer than usual to raise inflation. Although ample liquidity may have weakened the credit channel, evidence from new loan rates suggests that it remains active. BOT’s liquidity management should aim at maintaining favorable financing conditions (see Box 2 and chapter 2 of the Selected Issues Paper). As the ongoing normalization of U.S. rates could lead to tighter financial conditions in Thai markets, liquidity management, together with appropriate forward guidance, should keep the shape of the yield curve, at least the short-end, aligned with an accommodative monetary policy stance.

In this regard, they welcomed policy normalization in advanced economies as it would reduce capital inflows pressures and hence the need for BOT operations in the FX market.

An important step was the designation of the five largest banks as Systemically Important Banks (SIBs), which are required to hold additional capital. In addition, the authorities are moving towards integrated supervision of financial conglomerates that own SIBs. Since these banks typically have important nonbank financial subsidiaries, this conglomerate focus should help close regulatory gaps between the banking and nonbanking sectors. It involves enhanced collaboration among the key supervisory bodies—the BOT, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Office of Insurance Commission—through committee structures that support a more integrated assessment of financial risks. Finalizing arrangements for the resolution of financial institutions should also enhance system stability. Efforts to address AML/CFT shortcomings identified in the 2017 Asia Pacific Group Mutual Assessment Report are ongoing, including strengthening the risk-based supervision of AML/CFT, improving implementation of preventive measures, and enhancing information sharing among supervisory bodies and the Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO).",FALSE,normal

They noted that pockets of vulnerability could pose systemic risk, citing the high household debt-to-income ratio where the pace of deleveraging had been slow. They reiterated their concern that search-for-yield behavior associated with low interest rates could lead to underpricing of risk. Indications of this, they mentioned, included the high volume of investment in Foreign Investment Funds with exposures concentrated in a few countries and saving cooperatives’ assets that continued to grow at a high rate.

The Eastern Economic Corridor: Thailand 4.0 in Action Effective implementation of the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) could provide significant fiscal stimulus, in line with staff’s advice, while also crowding in private investment and raising long-term output. The EEC can be an important catalyst to spur domestic demand. As a key pillar of the Thailand 4.0 strategy to propel the economy into the digital age, the EEC projects can play an important role in scaling up public infrastructure investment and boosting growth in the short and medium term. The EEC covers three provinces along the eastern seaboard —Chonburi, Rayong, and Chachoengsao—that have successfully supported Thailand’s manufacturing base for the past 30 years. The objective is to upgrade and expand the region’s connectivity and transform the country into a strategic gateway to Asia. The plan features a significant contribution from PPPs, which should help crowd-in private investment and further boost domestic demand. The EEC plan is appropriately ambitious. It covers 15 groups of infrastructure and development projects spanning 5 years (2018-2023) for a total investment of about US$50 billion. Sixty percent of public infrastructure investment is expected to be executed through PPPs, with government and state-owned enterprises contributing 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

The awards for these projects is expected to be completed by end-2018, with implementation extending to 2025. Implementation of EEC projects can provide fiscal stimulus in line with staff’s advice. While the baseline has 0.6 percentage points to 0.7 percentage points of GDP in additional public investment, more could be done. Staff recommended scaling up infrastructure spending by an additional (cumulative) 5 percent of GDP over three years. The additional fiscal stimulus is expected to have a pronounced impact on private investment through crowding in. Growth would be higher by a cumulative 2.3 percentage points over the projection period. Such infrastructure push can help inflation converge to target at a faster pace and frontload the adjustment in external rebalancing, especially if accompanied by an accommodative monetary policy (see Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues Paper). Success of the EEC plan hinges on efficient execution that maximizes the return on public investment. Thailand’s investment efficiency was assessed by the IMF’s PIMA to be quite strong compared to peers. It also identified weaknesses that could impact project implementation.

Evidence points to a somewhat weaker but nonetheless still active transmission mechanism. To assess the strength of monetary policy transmission, several components of the transmission mechanism are examined. These include the main inflation drivers, the bank credit channel, and the extent to which financial market conditions may currently be supportive for the transmission of monetary impulses. Evidence on inflation dynamics suggests that the Phillips Curve has flattened, reflecting a smaller impact of economic activity on inflation. At the same time the expectations channel has deteriorated, with both lower inflation expectations and higher inflation persistence delaying the return of inflation to target. Together, these two pieces of evidence point to a very slow recovery in inflation, in particular if compared to previous historical episodes of low inflation, despite the recent pickup in economic activity.

Long run inflation expectations continue to weaken and are below the target band. Maintain exchange rate flexibility as first line of defense, with FX intervention limited to avoiding disorderly market conditions. The exchange rate has appreciated by 3.3 percent in real terms and 9 percent versus the U.S. dollar in nominal terms in 2017. Strengthen financial stability and further develop macroprudential tools to deal with emerging pockets of fragility. Financial stability has strengthened with the designation of five systemically important banks (SIBs) and BOT measures to contain risks from the cooperatives sector. Macroprudential tools, such as LTVs, have been effective in containing risks in the real estate sector and high household debt. Use fiscal space to boost public investment. Public investment contracted in 2017, in part due to teething issues with the new procurement law which led to delays in investment execution, especially by SOEs. The medium-term fiscal framework should include forecasts for the general government and SOEs. A Fiscal Responsibility Law was approved in January 2018, under which a medium-term fiscal framework will become compulsory and include forecasts for the general government and SOEs. Reform pension scheme to address design shortcoming and population aging A National Pension Committee has been formed to propose a national strategy that addresses system fragmentation and design shortcomings. Forthcoming IMF TA will help with this strategy. Reform social safety nets to mitigate risks of old-age poverty with better targeting of vulnerable groups.

Over the medium term, overly ambitious growth targets, including by over reliance on credit stimulus and investment, lead to unsustainable policies, reducing fiscal space, further increasing financial imbalances. A sharp adjustment would weaken domestic demand, with adverse international spillovers, including a pullback in capital flows to EMs (medium likelihood).

Cyber-attacks M M: Cyber-attacks on interconnected financial systems and broader private and public institutions that trigger systemic financial instability or widely disrupt socio-economic activities. BOT should sustain current efforts to strengthen its capacity to deal with cyber attacks and fintech- related challenges. Domestic Risks Heightened political uncertainty M H: Consumer and business confidence would be damaged, dampening private investment and FDI inflows. Public investment execution would slow down. Capital outflows would put pressure on credit and asset markets. Tourism could also be affected. Allow automatic stabilizers to work. Provide adequate liquidity to banks to minimize disruptions in the financial system. Let the exchange rate be a key shock absorber in case of capital outflows, but use intervention to avoid disorderly market conditions. Weaker crowding-in of private investment M M: Lower-than-projected private investment would reduce domestic demand in the cyclically weak economy and undermine Thailand’s potential in the longer term. It may also weaken confidence in the government’s ability to improve the business environment, denting private sentiment and FDI. Use available room for additional fiscal and monetary stimulus. Strengthen efforts to implement structural reforms and improve the business and investment environment. Accelerate the execution of large infrastructure projects and PPPs with capacity to crowd-in private sector interest. Entrenched low inflation M H: Entrenched low inflation would worsen the macroeconomic environment, increasing real interest rates and the real debt burden, and posing risks to corporate, household, and financial sector balance sheets. Lower the policy rate and strengthen communication to anchor inflation expectations. Consider additional fiscal stimulus, consistent with long-term goals and fiscal sustainability, within a credible medium-term fiscal framework. Household debt overhang boiling over M M: Highly leveraged households may hold back spending or banks may tighten credit supply, which would dampen consumption.

Using the big Data approach1 of measuring political uncertainty, we calculated 3-year rolling correlations between our big data measure of political uncertainty and national accounts- based private consumption data and this suggests an increasingly highly negative correlation between the two variables in recent years. Furthermore, regression analysis also show that political uncertainty tends to negatively impact private consumption in Thailand.

Subsequently, the NIIP declined to -24 percent of GDP in 2014, despite CA surpluses averaging 1.6 percent of GDP, largely due to valuation changes and other stock-flow adjustments. 2/ The NIIP further declined to around -7 percent of GDP in 2017 with steady increase in gross assets, accompanied by a rising CA surplus and subdued FDI, amid steadily rising outward investment by residents. Assessment. In 2017, gross assets were 100 percent of GDP (44 percent being reserve assets) and gross liabilities were 107 percent of GDP (dominated by non-debt liabilities). External debt declined from nearly 35 percent of GDP in 2014 to 32.7 percent of GDP (one-fifth being public debt). Short term debt stood at 14 percent of GDP. There are limited risks to external debt sustainability as external debt is projected to remain relatively low over the medium term and net foreign liabilities as a share of GDP are expected to stabilize. Overall Assessment 1/ The external position in 2017 was substantially higher than warranted by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.

45,17,"External rebalancing requires a concerted policy effort to support domestic demand and a gradual, sustained appreciation of the REER over the medium term. Mutually reinforcing monetary and fiscal stimulus, coupled with structural reforms, should support domestic demand and help lower the current account gap over time. Such strategy would facilitate the needed REER appreciation through a growth-driven process, boosting real incomes. The boost to public infrastructure within available fiscal space should crowd-in private investment. The authorities should continue addressing structural rigidities by reforming social safety nets, notably the fragmented pension schemes compounded by widespread informality, and reducing barriers to investment, especially in the services sector. The exchange rate should move flexibly as the key shock absorber. Intervention should be limited to avoiding disorderly market conditions. Reserves exceed all adequacy metrics, thus there is no need to build up reserves for precautionary purposes. Current account Background. Thailand’s current account (CA) has been volatile over the last decade, ranging from a deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 2005 to a surplus of 7¼ percent of GDP in 2009. The CA then dropped to a deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP by 2013 and rose back to a record surplus of 11.7 percent of GDP in 2016 (with the 5-year average of 4.4 percent of GDP). The 12.9 percent of GDP turnaround in the CA between 2013-16 can be largely accounted for by a 5.8 percent of GDP decline in net oil imports and a 3 percent of GDP rise in the services balance (mainly tourism). Net oil imports and tourism also account for the bulk (two-thirds) of the increase in the CA in 2016. The CA surplus modestly declined to 10.6 percent of GDP in 2017, reflecting an increase of imports of 1½ percent of GDP. Assessment. The EBA CA model estimated a small (0.4 percent of GDP) terms-of-trade (ToT) cyclical adjustment, with a cyclically-adjusted 2017 CA of 10.2 percent of GDP and a CA norm of 1.2 percent of GDP. The CA gap of 9.0 percent of GDP consists of an identified policy gap of 2.3 percent of GDP (1.7 percent of GDP from domestic policy gaps), and an unexplained residual of 6.7 percent of GDP. The large unexplained residual partly reflects Thailand-specific features not fully captured by the EBA model. Notwithstanding continued improvement in ToT and the boom in tourism, private domestic demand remained weak, reflecting a cautious response to these positive shocks during the ongoing political transition that weighed on private sector confidence. Considering these factors, staff assesses the CA surplus to be 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent of GDP larger than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.3/ The CA gap is expected to narrow over the medium term, as policy stimulus is deployed, political uncertainty dissipates, private confidence recovers, and steps are taken to reform the safety net. Real exchange rate Background. The baht has been on a broadly stable real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciation trend since the mid-2000s. Exceptional periods were the Fed’s tapering talk in mid-2013 and the domestic monetary policy easing cycle in 2015: Q1, when the baht depreciated for several quarters. The REER resumed its gradual real appreciation trend in 2016 and continued this trend in 2017. In 2017, the REER appreciated by 3.4 percent relative to 2016 4/. Assessment 5/. Using an elasticity of 0.6, staff assesses the 2017 REER to be 6 percent to 13 percent below levels consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. This gap is expected to narrow over the medium term as policy stimulus and structural reform are deployed, supporting domestic demand and a growth-driven real exchange rate appreciation process. Capital and financial accounts: flows and policy measures Background. The capital and financial account balance has been negative since 2013. In 2017, the net negative balance amounted to 4 percent of GDP. Outward FDI hit a record high of 4.6 percent of GDP owing to Thai firms’ overseas investment. Outward portfolio investment reached 2.6 percent of GDP (two-thirds are equity securities), higher than portfolio inflows of 2.1 percent of GDP (mostly concentrated in the long-term securities issued by the government and corporate sectors). Net other investment outflows was about 1 percent of GDP. The authorities continued with financial account liberalization, encouraging outward investment by residents. Assessment. Up to 2013, Thailand enjoyed overall portfolio inflows benefiting from its strong fundamentals. But from 2013, Thailand has faced headwinds, including the Fed’s interest rate lift-off, China’s slowdown, and political uncertainty. Capital outflows are manageable considering the resilient external sector and the flexibility of the baht, partially offsetting the current account surplus. FX intervention and reserves level Background. The exchange rate regime is classified as (de jure and de facto) floating. International reserves were 44½ percent of GDP in 2017, standing at over three times short-term debt, 234 percent of the IMF’s reserve metric unadjusted for capital controls, and 278 percent of the metric adjusted for capital controls. Staff considers the unadjusted adequacy metric to be more appropriate. (The adjusted metric relies on de jure capital controls, which fail to capture recent liberalization measures and the extent to which controls are binding). Assessment. Interventions appear to have been mostly one-sided, as suggested by the sizable and continuous monthly increase in the stock of reserves and FX forward position during 2017 (the only proxies for intervention, as actual intervention data are not published). International reserves (including net forward position) increased by US$41.7 billion (9 percent of GDP) during 2017. Reserves are higher than the range of IMF’s adequacy metrics and there is no need to build up reserves for precautionary purposes. The exchange rate should move flexibly, acting as a shock absorber, with intervention limited to avoiding disorderly market conditions. Technical Background Notes",FALSE,normal
45,18,"1 The assessment is based on the current EBA model. Preliminary figures from the refined model indicate a similar assessment. 2 These persistent negative valuation effects during 2010-14 have been driven mainly by capital inflows contributing to the growth of asset prices and baht appreciation. 3 The EBA model has a very large (and rising since 2013) unexplained residual for Thailand, likely driven by imperfect measurement of the large, positive ToT shock, the boom in tourism, and political uncertainty. Staff adjustments improve the measurement of these Thailand-specific cyclical and transitory factors through (i) updated weights in the EBA terms of trade index, with an adjustment of 1-1.5 percent of GDP; (ii) an estimate of the cyclical component in the recent boom in tourism, with an adjustment of 0.5-1.0 percent of GDP; and (iii) an estimate of the transitory impact of the ongoing political transition not captured by the institutional quality variables included in the EBA model, with an adjustment of 0 -3 percent of GDP. Moreover, the public health expenditure variable does not fully reflect the largely underdeveloped social safety nets, including low minimum pensions accruing to the large informal sector, which contribute to the current high levels of precautionary savings. 4 The REER appreciated more than 6 percent since 2005. 5 The EBA index REER gap in 2017 is estimated at -3.3 percent; the EBA level REER gap is estimated at -12.1 percent.",FALSE,normal

Thailand’s external debt is projected to remain relatively low over the medium term, reaching 32.8 percent of GDP in 2023 under the baseline scenario. Stress tests indicate that external debt would remain stable under various scenarios such as higher interest rate, weaker GDP growth, a lower current account balance, and a one-time 30 percent depreciation of the baht. Under these stress scenarios, the external debt-to-GDP ratio rises somewhat above the baseline over the projection period. In the case of the exchange rate depreciation scenario, the debt ratio would rise to about 48.3 percent of GDP. However, this scenario does not take into account the adjustment that trade flows would have if such depreciation were to occur (i.e., a sharp improvement in the current account that would significantly bring down the debt ratio).",FALSE,normal

52,4,"Exchange Rate Arrangement: The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. Under the inflation- targeting monetary policy framework, the value of the baht is allowed to be determined by market forces, reflecting demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. In the case that the resulting movements in Thai baht (THB) are deemed excessive and unjustified by fundamentals, foreign exchange intervention can be undertaken. During 2017, the REER appreciated at an increasing pace, resulting in 3.4 percent real effective appreciation and 9.6 percent nominal appreciation versus the dollar. The large current account surplus and sizable portfolio inflows were the main drivers, only partially offset by net outflows in FDI and other investment. Last Article IV Consultation: Thailand is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on May 17, 2017. Copy of the Staff Report could be downloaded from this link. Recent Technical Assistance: FAD: A mission in January 2018 reviewed the design and administration of the Government Welfare Program and the Low-Income Earners Registry, and proposed changes that may improve the coverage, targeting effectiveness, and adequacy of social assistance benefits. STA: A mission in February 2018 provided technical assistance on compilation of a national residential property price index, aiming at improving the methodologies and further developing property price statistics. MCM: A mission in March 2018 reviewed the functioning of the newly established Financial Stability Unit and macroprudential stress-testing framework, aiming at helping Thailand to acquire a fully functioning analytical and policy making capacity to maintain financial stability.

54,6,"General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. The authorities have continued to improve the quality and coverage of data. The dissemination of additional data may enhance the basis for macroeconomic analysis. National accounts: The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) compiles annual and quarterly GDP estimates using both the production and expenditure approaches. The annual GDP volume measures are derived at previous year’s prices and as chain-linked indices with 2002 as the reference year. The NESDB introduced new quarterly GDP current price and chain-linked volume estimates in May 2015. Price statistics: The Bureau of Trade and Economic Indexes (BTEI) compiles and disseminates a monthly consumer price index with weights based on expenditure data collected from households during the 2015 Socio-Economic Survey since January 2017. Index coverage is restricted to middle-income urban households. In addition to headline CPI, the BTEI publishes aggregate indexes for the low-income and rural populations. The BTEI also publishes monthly producer price index with base year 2010. The Bank of Thailand disseminates a RPPI covering metropolitan Bangkok and STA has provided technical assistance towards broadening coverage to include other regions. Government finance statistics: The authorities provide data to the Fund consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2014 (GFSM 2014).

57,4,"1. The Thai authorities would like to express their sincere appreciation to the IMF mission team for the constructive and candid discussions, which centered on policies towards a more balanced-growth. While the emphases of the authorities differ from staff’s recommendations on a few points, they welcome staff’s assessment of Thailand’s positive economic outlook with sustained growth momentum in the near term and broadly share staff’s view on risks to growth. Recent Developments and Near-Term Outlook",FALSE,normal
57,5,"2. Economic growth continues to gain further traction. The economy grew by 3.9 percent in 2017, higher than staff’s projection of 3.2 percent in the Article IV Staff Report last year, reflecting positive developments in the Thai economy. Going forward, the growth momentum is expected to continue, and be driven by exports of goods and services, while domestic demand will improve gradually. The authorities also expect public investment, especially in infrastructure projects, to continue to support growth. Economic growth is expected to be more balanced and is projected to grow by 4.1 percent in 2018.",FALSE,normal
57,6,"3. While the overall risk to growth is expected to be balanced in the near-term, the Thai economy faces downside risks, particularly on the external front. Stronger-than- expected external demand presents an important upside risk to the outlook; however, uncertainties pertaining to economic and foreign trade policies of major economies as well as geopolitical risks could have an adverse impact on the Thai economy. Against this background, structural challenges which hindered domestic demand need to be addressed and the authorities remain committed to undertaking such structural reforms towards a more broad-based, balanced, as well as sustained growth. Monetary Policy",FALSE,normal
57,7,"4. The views of the authorities differ from staff on the need for further monetary policy easing. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintains that the policy rate of 1.5 percent is appropriately accommodative. Short-term government bond yields have moved below the policy rate, implying sufficiently accommodative liquidity and credit conditions. Unlike conditions in Advanced Economies during the GFC, economic and financial conditions in EMEs do not warrant abnormally low policy rate or near zero lower bound as the downside risks on saving incentives and financial stability far outweigh the extra push to bring headline inflation to target.",FALSE,normal
57,8,NA,FALSE,empty
58,1,NA,FALSE,empty
58,2,"5. Under the current circumstance of weak monetary policy transmission mechanism, the benefits of a policy rate cut would have to be better calibrated against the risks to financial stability. They are particularly concerned that further easing might exacerbate the already-high level of household debt as well as the search-for-yield behaviors that could lead to underpricing of risk which is detrimental to long term sustainable growth.",FALSE,normal
58,3,"6. The MPC has continuously communicated their policy intention under the flexible inflation targeting framework, especially the need to balance between achieving the inflation target and limiting financial vulnerabilities. As the ultimate goal of macroeconomic policy is long-run economic welfare, the pursuit of inflation target should be done flexibly, as price stability without financial stability could be counter-productive.",FALSE,normal
58,4,"7. While inflation has previously been influenced largely by supply-side factors, medium-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Inflation in April edged up to 1.07 percent, reaching the lower bound of the target range. The authorities expect headline inflation to continue to pick up gradually on the back of stronger domestic demand and higher oil prices. In addition, recent Business Sentiment Index survey confirms an inflation expectation of around 2 percent, falling within the target range of 2.5±1.5 percent.",FALSE,normal
58,5,"8. On staff’s recommendation to address financial stability concerns through counter-cyclical macroprudential policy, the authorities view that it has proved somewhat challenging in practice due to limited institutional capacity. Targeting macroprudential measures in specific sectors may push financial activities to the areas outside regulatory umbrella. The authorities believe that macroprudential tools should be used to complement rather than offset broad stance of monetary policy. Foreign Exchange Policy",FALSE,normal
58,6,"9. The authorities commit to having a flexible exchange rate as a primary shock absorber and stress that market intervention was never intended to resist trend appreciation. But to avoid disorderly market adjustment that could derail the recovery, intervention is necessary during the episodes of intense capital inflows, resulting from excessive global liquidity. This is partly because Thai Baht has been perceived as a safe haven asset by foreign investors. In 2017, Thai Baht appreciated by 4.4 percent in REER terms and around 10 percent against the U.S. dollars, making Thai Baht one of the best performing currencies in East Asia. In this light, the ongoing policy normalization in advanced economies is welcome as it has presented opportunities for the authorities to downsize the central bank’s balance sheet in the past months.",FALSE,normal
58,7,10. The authorities are concerned that the publication of FX intervention data might induce self-fulfilling speculative activities on Thai Baht and further complicate central bank’s FX operations. The authorities view that their publication of international reserves,FALSE,normal

59,2,"on a weekly basis already exceeds international standard on data transparency. In addition, they call for staff’s careful interpretation in its analysis of change in reserves, as part of it was valuation change.",FALSE,normal
59,3,"11. On the external balance assessment, the authorities welcome staff’s acknowledgement that the large current account surplus in recent years is attributed to Thailand’s structural factors, which could not be fully explained by the EBA model – e.g. structural rigidities related to developments in tourism sector. Given that structural adjustment would take time to materialize, the authorities stress that external rebalancing should not burden solely on exchange rate adjustment. The appropriate mix of policies and measures must be pursued flexibly in light of changing economic circumstances specific to each country to achieve not only external rebalancing, but also economic and financial stability.",FALSE,normal
59,4,"12. The current account surplus has been adjusting in the right direction and will continue to decline over the medium term. The authorities note that the ongoing public investment, including the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and a number of structural reform projects, should strengthen domestic demand and moderate the current account surplus going forward. Financial Sector Developments",FALSE,normal
59,5,"13. The authorities are encouraged by staff’s assessment that the Thai financial system remains sound. While the banking sector has been profitable, with adequate capital buffers and provisions, as reflected by the core financial soundness indicators, the authorities have taken further steps to strengthen the financial stability framework. Importantly, the five largest banks have been defined as Domestically Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) requiring them to hold additional capital. In addition, the authorities introduced macroprudential policies to tighten limits on credit card debt and personal loans in September 2017 with an aim to containing risks from high household debt. As rightly pointed out by staff, there has also been greater coordination and cooperation among key financial regulators in jointly addressing the bouts of volatility. Going forward, the authorities will remain vigilant to the change in financial landscape from the development of Financial Technology and potential challenges arising from cybersecurity issues.",FALSE,normal
59,6,"14. The authorities are of the view that vulnerabilities in the non-banking sector, if not properly contained, could have adverse impact on economic and financial stability. While household debt data on banks’ balance sheets are benign, real debt obligation-to- income remains high and deleveraging process has been slow. The search-for-yield behavior could lead to the underpricing of risk as witnessed, for instance, in the expanded size of saving cooperatives. The authorities have developed a macro-stress testing exercise that",FALSE,normal

60,2,would help improve the overall soundness of Thai financial stability. They will continue to closely monitor pockets of risks in the financial system and look forward to the upcoming FSAP which will help further identify risks in the financial system. Fiscal Policy and Structural Reforms,FALSE,normal
60,3,"15. The authorities will use the fiscal space to achieve the long-term objective of uplifting potential growth through infrastructure improvement. The authorities agree that a large scale of public investment through the implementation of EEC and other logistic projects will crowd-in private investment and help promote external rebalancing. While noting benefits associated with scaling up and frontloading public investment, the authorities underscore that the existing fiscal space must be utilized efficiently and in a well-targeted manner.",FALSE,normal
60,4,"16. The authorities are aware of the need to address rising age-related spending over the medium to long term horizon. While recognizing that VAT rate increase could strengthen revenue, they are mindful that such policy action at this juncture might dampen the nascent domestic demand. In this connection, the authorities are cognizant of the need to find an alternative source of revenue, such as the revision to property and inheritance tax, to prepare for demographic shift. Progress has been made towards a comprehensive review of the pension system to enhance adequacy, coverage and sustainability with the establishment of the National Pension Committee.",FALSE,normal
60,5,"17. On structural reform agenda, the authorities are determined to enhance economic growth and productivity to help Thailand become a high-income country within two decades. Guided by its National Strategy and National Reform Plans, the authorities intend to improve competitiveness and quality of human resources, as well as promote sustainable and inclusive growth. In this regard, the authorities have stepped up their efforts to improve the business climate. The new Trade Competition Act has become effective since October 2017 to help promote fairer trade and investment including less privilege for state-owned enterprises. Also, the authorities highlight significant improvement in ease of doing business in Thailand in recent years and will continue their endeavor to further reducing regulatory red tape. In addition, progress has also been made in advancing the education reform by reducing inequity and promoting teaching quality. At the same time, the authorities have strengthened the welfare program to be better targeted through a low-income earners registration program with occupational training opportunity to upgrade their labor skill and help achieve better living standards.",FALSE,normal
