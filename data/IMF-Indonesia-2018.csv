2,17,The Indonesian economy has continued to perform well. Real GDP growth accelerated slightly,TRUE,normal
2,18,"to 5.1 percent in Q3:2017 from 5 percent in 2016 and H1:2017, led by robust exports and fixed",TRUE,normal
2,19,investment. The output gap is estimated at –0.5 percent of GDP. Inflation fell to 3.3 percent in,TRUE,normal
2,20,"November, at the lower half of the official target band (4±1 percent), due to the slightly negative",TRUE,normal
2,21,"output gap and stable food prices, which more than offset the increase in electricity prices earlier",TRUE,normal
2,22,in the year due to improved targeting of subsidies. Core inflation has remained stable at around,TRUE,normal
2,23,3 percent. The current account deficit declined to 1.5 percent of GDP in Q1-Q3:2017 due to,TRUE,normal
2,24,"higher exports. However, credit growth remains slow reflecting both weak demand and banks’",TRUE,normal
2,25,tight lending standards.,TRUE,normal
2,26,NA,TRUE,empty
2,27,"The economic outlook is positive. Real GDP growth is projected at 5.1 percent in 2017, rising",TRUE,normal
2,28,"gradually to 5.6 percent over the medium term, led by robust domestic demand. Inflation is",TRUE,normal
2,29,"projected to remain around 3.5 percent, within the official target range, due to stable food and",TRUE,normal
2,30,"administered prices, and well anchored inflation expectations. The current account deficit is",TRUE,normal
2,31,expected to remain contained at near 2 percent of GDP due to firm commodity prices and robust,TRUE,normal
2,32,"exports. Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, including spikes in global financial",TRUE,normal
2,33,"volatility, uncertainty around U.S. economic policies, lower growth in China, and geopolitical",TRUE,normal

3,31,"domestic revenue, as well as greater private sector participation, including foreign direct",TRUE,normal

6,6,"KEY ISSUES Context. The Indonesian economy continues to perform well. Economic growth has stabilized at near 5 percent, inflation has moderated, the current account deficit is manageable, and systemic risks are contained. Indonesia is in a good position to address its socio-economic challenges. Creating sufficient jobs for its young and growing population and reaping the benefits of the demographic dividend requires higher sustainable and inclusive growth and economic diversification. Outlook. Growth is projected at 5.1 percent in 2017 and 5.6 percent over the medium term, led by robust domestic demand. Inflation is expected to remain within the target band due to stable administered prices and well-anchored inflation expectations. The current account deficit is expected to remain contained due to robust exports. Risks, however, remain tilted to the downside and are mainly external. Main policy recommendations:",FALSE,normal
6,7,"• Boosting potential growth requires a comprehensive, self-reinforcing, and properly sequenced fiscal-structural reform package. The near-term priority should be on structural reforms with low fiscal costs. Gains in growth from these reforms and additional revenue from a medium-term revenue strategy would allow for higher spending on infrastructure, education, health, and further structural reforms. Meanwhile, the increase in infrastructure spending should be paced in line with available financing and the economy’s absorptive capacity.",FALSE,normal
6,8,"• Given the slightly negative output gap, slow credit growth, and downside risks, the near-term policy mix should support growth while preserving stability. Monetary policy should continue focusing on price stability and supporting growth, while exchange rate flexibility should be maintained. Fiscal adjustment should be gradual in 2018 to protect growth, while rebuilding fiscal buffers.",FALSE,normal
6,9,"• Efforts should continue to enhance financial oversight and crisis management. The enforcement of prudential regulations should be strengthened, while restructured and special mention loans should continue to be closely monitored, while properly enforcing loan classification to avoid evergreening.

9,5,"1. The Indonesian economy continues to perform well. Economic growth has stabilized at near 5 percent, inflation has moderated, the current account deficit is manageable, and systemic risks are contained.1 The current favorable external environment, characterized by a pickup in global growth, supportive financial conditions, and a partial recovery of commodity prices, provides a window of opportunity to push forward the government’s reform agenda, while addressing vulnerabilities and risks, including the reliance on external financing.",FALSE,normal
9,6,"2. Against this backdrop, the country is in a favorable position to address its socio- economic challenges. The government’s objective to achieve higher sustainable and inclusive growth will help create jobs for the young and growing population. Indonesia’s working age population is growing rapidly, at 1.6 percent or 2.5 million people per year (Box 1), which could increase further youth unemployment (19.4 percent in 2016).2 In addition to faster economic growth, reaping the benefits of the demographic dividend requires diversifying the economy away from agriculture and towards industry and services, which have larger elasticities of employment growth to output growth.",FALSE,normal
9,7,"3. Discussions focused on policies to boost potential growth in the medium term as well as on the appropriate policy mix in the near term. Increasing potential growth requires a self- reinforcing fiscal-structural reform package that mobilizes revenues to finance development spending (infrastructure, education, health, and targeted transfers), and supports structural reforms to the product, labor, and financial markets. The near-term policy mix, given the slightly negative output gap, slow credit growth, and downside risks, should protect growth while preserving stability.",FALSE,normal
9,8,"4. The authorities’ policies have been broadly in line with past policy advice. Monetary policy easing in 2017 was appropriate given cyclical considerations and moderate inflation, and there has been further progress with monetary operations reforms.

The main risks are external, including a reversal in capital inflows (triggered by global financial volatility or uncertainty around U.S. monetary and fiscal policies), lower growth in China, and geopolitical tensions. The impact of these shocks could be amplified by the fiscal and corporate sectors’ heavy reliance on nonresident financing (61 percent and 33 percent of total debt, respectively).

They disagree with some indicators used in the EBA model to measure country risk (those of the International Country Risk Guide). Therefore, the CA norm resulting from the EBA model does not reflect Indonesia’s needs of higher CA deficits to finance investment on infrastructure and critical structural reforms.

13,7,"18. In the context of declining tax revenues in recent years, the authorities have improved the quality of public spending. a. Following the decline in oil and gas revenue amounting to 2 percent of GDP since 2014, the government has aimed to mobilize revenues by strengthening tax administration. It implemented a tax amnesty in July 2016–March 2017 with mixed results. Amnesty revenues, at 1.1 percent of GDP, exceeded market expectations, but other non-oil and gas revenue fell, likely impacted by the suspension of audits for amnesty participants. Despite these efforts, non-oil and gas tax revenues have declined by 0.5 percent of GDP since 2014. b. In response, the government has rebalanced spending to priority sectors and improved efficiency. While total public spending has fallen by 2 percent of GDP since 2014, capital spending has risen by 1 percent of GDP. The targeting of electricity subsidies to low-income households has been improved, and performance criteria for transfers to local governments have been adopted. Efficiency savings on education spending are to be channeled to a trust fund to finance future education needs. However, some reforms have been delayed, such as the application of fully automatic formula-based fuel and electricity pricing mechanisms. The prices of low octane gasoline and electricity have not been adjusted since H1:2017.",FALSE,normal

Although asset repatriation during the amnesty was modest at 1.2 percent of GDP, assets declared totaled 40 percent of GDP. The authorities plan to use this data to improve tax compliance, assisted by the International Automatic Exchange of Information initiative. To help these efforts, the authorities passed a law that will give tax officials direct access to bank accounts owned by both Indonesian citizens and foreigners starting in 2018. The authorities are also developing a proposal for a MTRS to raise additional revenue, which they expect to finalize by March 2018. Staff Position",FALSE,normal

Total budgeted expenditure is projected to be 0.3 percent of GDP higher than the projected outturn in 2017, led by higher current and capital spending, partly offset by lower transfers to local governments.",FALSE,normal
20,9,"38. The public sector’s reliance on nonresident financing stabilized in 2017, although at a high level. Public debt is moderate at 29 percent of GDP, but the share of public debt held by nonresidents remained high at 61 percent in September 2017, broadly unchanged from 2016. The high reliance on nonresident financing makes public debt vulnerable to exchange rate and capital flow volatility. However, government bond yields have been relatively resilient in recent episodes of high global financial volatility. For example, 10-year bond yields increased only from 7.2 percent to 7.9 percent between October and December 2016 when global financial volatility spiked following the U.S. presidential elections, and have since declined to 6.5 percent in November 2017. Staff Position",FALSE,normal
20,10,"39. The authorities should aim for a gradual adjustment in 2018 to balance stability and cyclical considerations. Indonesia has some fiscal space, allowing for a slower than planned pace of adjustment. If revenues continue to surprise on the downside, adhering to the fiscal deficit target of 2.2 percent of GDP would require cutting expenditure, which would weaken domestic demand and limit resources for investment in infrastructure and critical structural reforms. Given the slightly negative output gap, a more gradual fiscal adjustment (a deficit target of up to 2.5 percent of GDP) would be more appropriate to protect growth while gradually lowering the primary deficit and rebuilding fiscal buffers. The resulting fiscal stance would be less contractionary than in the budget plan, with the cyclically adjusted primary balance rising by 0.2 percent of GDP. The deficit should not exceed 2.5 percent of GDP to preserve market confidence in the fiscal rule. Within the budget envelope, there is still scope to continue rebalancing away from untargeted subsidies towards more support for social spending, public investment, and structural reforms.

21,5,"40. The authorities broadly agreed that fiscal adjustment should be gradual in 2018. Fiscal policy will continue supporting growth through spending on infrastructure, health, education, and social transfers as envisaged in the budget. But it will not be used to stimulate aggregate demand beyond the budget plan. The authorities recognized a potential risk of revenue shortfalls in 2017, but they have already anticipated them to keep the budget deficit at a level well below the deficit ceiling. They believe that revenue and expenditure will be less volatile going forward, as the one-off shocks to revenue since 2014 will taper off, including those from the 2014-15 fall in commodity prices, the 2015-16 special tax on SOE asset reevaluation, and the 2016-17 tax amnesty. They also indicated that with the spirit of a better targeted mechanism for energy subsidies, they will keep monitoring energy prices and ensure the protection of the poor from hikes in energy prices. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies",FALSE,normal
21,6,"41. Bank Indonesia (BI) recently eased monetary policy. BI cut the policy rate by 50 basis points to 4.25 percent in August-September 2017, after cutting it by 150 basis points in 2016 and then holding it unchanged for 10 months. These actions were motivated by the moderate inflation outlook, the slightly negative output gap, slow credit growth, and lower external pressures. The rupiah has depreciated by 0.3 percent against the U.S. dollar in the first 11 months of 2017, and international reserves have risen by US$9.6 billion, due to higher foreign currency proceeds from international bond issuances, tax revenues, and oil and gas export receipts, and BI’s FX intervention aimed at stabilizing the rupiah in line with its fundamental value.",FALSE,normal
21,7,"42. There has been further progress with the reform of monetary operations. The interbank rate has moved closer to the policy rate since August 2016, when the policy rate was changed to the 7-day reverse repo rate and the interest rate corridor was narrowed. In July 2017, BI launched a partial reserve requirement (RR) averaging of 1.5 percent, out of the 6.5 percent current primary RR ratio, over a two-week period, allowing the floor of the RR ratio to be at 5 percent on any given day. This reform has benefited small banks with potential shortage of liquidity. BI has also moved to a variable-rate auction for its securities to encourage price discovery in the money markets. Issuance of T-bills has risen, providing more instruments at the short end of the yield curve. Staff Position",FALSE,normal
21,8,"43. The current stance of monetary policy is broadly appropriate. Recent monetary policy easing is adequate, given moderate inflation, the slightly negative output gap, and lower external pressures. With the real policy rate (1 percent) below the estimated neutral real rate (1¾ percent), monetary policy is sufficiently accommodative to support growth while maintaining price stability. Given external uncertainty, monetary policy should stay on hold in the immediate future, while BI assesses the pass-through of its recent actions.",FALSE,normal

Although the interbank rate has moved closer to the policy rate, market interest rates have been slow to adapt, particularly lending rates. Structural factors affecting the transmission include limited bank competition; distortionary interest rate caps; a weak credit culture; and low efficiency in the banking sector. Policy priorities include eliminating interest rate caps; limiting issuances of BI securities at the short end and minimizing overlap with MOF instruments; and improving banks’ asset quality through faster restructuring.",FALSE,normal

The current monetary policy stance is appropriate given the moderate inflation outlook and slightly negative output gap. Going forward, BI will continue to remain vigilant and formulate monetary policy in line with economic developments. The implementation of the RR averaging has been smooth and has helped small banks with potential shortage of liquidity. Large banks with ample liquidity have not made use of the extra degree of flexibility. BI plans to gradually increase the RR averaging from 1.5 percent to the total RR by 2021, based on review of the liquidity conditions and progress in financial market deepening. The authorities broadly agreed with the reform priorities to further strengthen monetary transmission.",FALSE,normal

BI continues to maintain a flexible exchange rate policy and to ensure the rupiah is in line with its fundamental value.

51,13,"Foreign asset and liability position and trajectory Background. At end-June 2017, Indonesia’s net international investment position (NIIP) stood at -35¾ percent of GDP, compared to -43¾ percent of GDP at end-2015 (and -39¼ percent at end-2012). The less negative net liability position was largely due to the disclosure of external financial assets held by residents under the tax amnesty program. At end- June 2017, gross external assets stood at 32½ percent of GDP (close to 40 percent being reserve assets) and gross external liabilities at 68¼ percent of GDP. Indonesia’s gross external debt was moderate at 34¼ percent of GDP at end- June 2017, with 19½ percent of external debt denominated in rupiah. About one-third of government’s external debt (at 17 percent of GDP at end-June 2017) was denominated in rupiah. Assessment. The level and composition of the NIIP and gross external debt indicate that Indonesia’s external position is sustainable, but nonresident holdings of rupiah denominated government bonds, with a 38 percent share of the total stock (or 6 percent of GDP) at end-October 2017, could be affected by global financial volatility. Staff projections for the current account suggest that the NIIP position as a percent of GDP will strengthen over the medium term. Overall Assessment The external position of Indonesia in 2017 was assessed to be broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. The recovery of commodity prices and external demand and relatively low projected world oil prices should help to contain the current account deficit. External financing appears sustainable, although the large share of foreign portfolio holdings makes the economy vulnerable to external shocks. Potential Policy Responses Continued flexibility of the exchange rate and market-determined bond yields would continue to underpin external stability, supported by monetary policy focused on containing inflation within Bank Indonesia’s target band. The fiscal position should be strengthened by accelerating tax reforms to boost investor confidence, keeping the fiscal deficit within the statutory limit. While expanding the safety-net could lead to a widening in the CA deficit over the medium term, pro- competitive structural policies, particularly easing non-tariff trade barriers and FDI restrictions would bolster exports and external competitiveness, helping contain the CA deficit, and continuing infrastructure investment and strengthening human capital (including through job placement services, vocational training, and better education) can help ease supply bottlenecks. Deepening financial markets would help to strengthen resilience to external shocks. Current account Background. Indonesia’s current account deficit is projected at 1.7 percent of GDP in 2017, an improvement from the peak of 3.2 percent in 2013, as the economy has adjusted to the low commodity prices. Exports and imports started to pick up in Q4: 2016, as commodity prices bottomed out. Over the medium term, a moderate increase in the current account deficit is expected from a rise in capital goods and raw material imports tied to infrastructure investment and a pickup in domestic demand. A gradual increase in manufacturing exports, stronger demand from trading partners, and relatively low projected world oil prices should help limit the current account deficit. Assessment. The EBA CA model suggests a gap of -0.1 percent for 2017, consistent with an estimated cyclically- adjusted CA balance of -1.4 percent of GDP and a norm of -1.3 percent of GDP. Taking uncertainties around the estimates into account, staff assesses that a norm of -2.3 percent to -0.3 percent of GDP is appropriate.1/ This suggests that the CA gap range of about -1.1 percent to 0.9 percent of GDP for 2017. Domestic policy gaps, including in social spending and policy gaps in partner countries (particularly fiscal) are largely offset by other distortions not captured by the model.

51,15,"Background. Compared to the 2016 average, the average REER appreciated by 2.1 percent in the first ten months of 2017, due to relatively higher inflation rate than its trading partners, as the average NEER remained broadly the same. Assessment. EBA index and level REER results point to an REER gap of about 0.5 percent to 3.9 percent for 2017, respectively, in line with staff’s REER gap assessment in the range of -4.5 percent to 5.5 percent (based on the CA assessment and estimated elasticities). Capital and financial accounts: flows and policy measures Background. In 2017: Q1–Q3, net capital and financial account inflows (3.1 percent of GDP) have been sustained by net FDI inflows (1.9 percent of GDP) and net portfolio inflows (2.5 percent of GDP), while net other investment inflows were at -1.3 percent. Assessment. Net and gross financial flows have been steady since the global financial crisis despite some short periods of volatility. The narrower current account deficit and strengthened policy framework, including exchange rate flexibility since mid-2013 have also helped reduce capital flow volatility. Continued strong policies focused on strengthening the fiscal position, keeping inflation in check, and easing supply bottlenecks would help sustain capital inflows in the medium term. FX intervention and reserves level Background. Since mid-2013, Indonesia has had a more flexible exchange rate policy framework. Its floating regime has better facilitated adjustments in exchange rates to market conditions. At end-November 2017, reserves were US$126 billion (equal to 12½ percent of GDP, about 133 percent of IMF’s reserve adequacy metric, and about 8 months of prospective imports of goods and services) compared to US$116.4 billion at end-2016. In addition, contingencies and swap lines amounting to about US$81½ billion are in place. Assessment. Volatile capital flows could cause reserves to decline significantly. While the composite metric may not adequately account for commodity price volatility, the current level of reserves (US$126 billion at end-November) should be sufficient to absorb most shocks, with predetermined drains also manageable. Intervention should aim primarily at preventing disorderly market conditions, while allowing the exchange rate to adjust to external shocks.

52,4,"Appendix III. Debt Sustainability Analysis Indonesia’s external debt remains moderate and sustainable, supported by robust real GDP growth and high nondebt generating capital inflows. Public debt is also moderate and sustainable. However, potentially weaker-than-expected revenue, contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public-private partnerships (PPPs) should be carefully monitored. Reliance on foreign investors remains sizable, which could leave Indonesia susceptible to capital flow reversals. External Debt Sustainability Indonesia’s external debt has stabilized at a moderate level after steady increases in recent years. External debt reached 34¼ percent of GDP in 2016, down from 36 percent in 2015, reflecting a decline in external debt of the nonbank private sector. General government external debt has been stable, including internationally issued bonds and holdings of domestic bonds by nonresidents. These trends are projected to continue, with external debt declining to 34 percent of GDP at end-2017 (Figure 1 and Table 1). External debt is projected to gradually decline in the medium term. In the baseline scenario, external debt would decline to 26.6 percent in 2022 reflecting strong real GDP growth and higher nondebt creating capital inflows to finance the current account deficits. Public and private external debt are expected to decline as external borrowing by the public sector is tightly regulated by an inter-ministerial committee and the domestic financial market develops. External debt sustainability is robust to interest rate and GDP shocks, but is more sensitive to current account and exchange rate shocks (Figure 2). A widening of the current account deficit from current levels would cause external debt to rise moderately (a one standard deviation shock would increase external debt to 31 percent of GDP by 2022). Exchange rate depreciation would have the largest impact—a 30 percent depreciation in 2018 would raise external debt to 46 percent of GDP in 2018 followed by a gradual decline to 37 percent of GDP by 2022. Public Debt Sustainability Indonesia’s public sector debt remains moderate. General government debt has declined steadily from 87 percent of GDP in 2000 to 28 percent in 2016, owing to a prudent fiscal stance, which has been anchored by a fiscal rule since 2003. This rule caps the general government deficit at 3 percent of GDP and debt at 60 percent. The debt dynamics have been also favorable, with strong real GDP growth and moderate real interest rates. In 2017, public debt is projected to rise to 29 percent of GDP, reflecting a slightly larger primary deficit than in the past but still within the fiscal rule. At the same time, foreign-currency denominated debt has fallen to less than half of total public sector debt, as issuance in the domestic rupiah bond market has grown. However, dependence on foreign investors remains sizable, with nonresidents holding 61 percent of general government debt. Moreover, the share of foreign ownership of rupiah-denominated government bonds rose from",FALSE,normal

Favorable debt dynamics, with a negative interest rate-growth differential (-0.9 percent over the medium term), would limit the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is expected to reach 30½ percent by 2022. Gross financing needs are also expected to remain moderate at around 4.4 percent of GDP over the medium term. Public debt dynamics are robust to both standard shocks and stress tests (Figures 4 and 5). Even under the most severe scenario with a combined macro-fiscal shock, total government debt would stabilize at 36 percent of GDP or 258 percent of revenue by 2022, with gross financing needs staying below 6 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, fiscal risks arising from potentially weaker-than- expected revenue and expanding balance sheets of SOEs and PPPs, will need to be managed carefully.",FALSE,normal

These packages aim to improve competitiveness and boost exports and investment by harmonizing regulations, simplifying bureaucratic processes, and ensuring law enforceability. Progress has been made in several areas. About 215 regulations have been revised to lower administrative burdens for businesses and reduce trade barriers; a transparent minimum wage formula has been adopted; the land acquisition process has been simplified; a 3-hour one-stop service has been launched; and a single submission system linked to local government regulations is being introduced. These reforms have led to a notable raise in Indonesia’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business from the 114th position in 2015 to the 72nd position in 2017. The authorities’ have adopted a more holistic approach in recent policy packages, with clear communication and strong coordination with local governments.",FALSE,normal

The authorities are committed to continue improving the business climate. They will make a comprehensive review of the key issues in the major sectors of the economy, address underlying bottlenecks, and continue to strengthen coordination with regional governments. Key measures in the 16 economic policy packages: Deregulation The authorities have revised 215 regulations, including 50 regulations at the Presidential Level and 165 regulations at the Ministerial/Institutional level.

61,5,"87 percent from 33 percent. Other measures include allowing for partnership with SMEs; introducing a grandfathering clause protecting existing foreign investor from potentially tighter protection in the future; and strengthening coordination with ministries, agencies, and regional governments. Investment Certainty The setting of the minimum wage has been made more transparent and predictable. Since 2016, the increases in the minimum wage is set by a formula that aligns it with inflation and real GDP growth. This formula has already been applied in major provinces, improving certainty for investors compared with past practices. For instance, the minimum wage rose by 40 percent in Jakarta in 2013, which significantly undermined business confidence in the region. The land acquisition process has been expedited. The new land acquisition regulation allows investors to pay for land in advance and be reimbursed after. This regulation is expected to avoid delays due to unallocated budget or late budget disbursements. Using the new regulation, the land acquisition process of Palembang-Indralaya section of the Tans-Sumatera toll road project and Java North Line Double track rail project have been completed after years of delay. Business Permit Procedures A one-stop 3-hour licensing service has been launched for nine types of licenses. These include licenses for business startups (investment license, tax registration number, certificate of incorporation, and company registration); trade (import identification, customs registration); employment (employment plan, working permit); and land information (letter of land availability). This initiative aims to lower waiting time, particularly for the energy and mineral resources sector, which had to wait for up to 40 days to obtain each license. In 2017, 130 projects have used this service, including 40 projects in the energy and mineral resources sector. A single submission system is being created. To expedite the issuance of business permits, the government is creating an online single submission system, where investors can obtain all required licenses at one place, including those of regional governments. The authorities are also forming task forces in ministries, agencies, and regional governments to implement the improved business licensing process and to oversee its implementation.",FALSE,normal

Other measures include reducing the number of prohibited and restricted goods; strengthening the Indonesia National Single Window authority; and enhancing the role of transportation insurance. Export and import procedures have been streamlined. Customs inspection at ports has been harmonized to curtail dwell time. Export and import permits have been simplified through single licensing at the border. Permits and documents settlement have been automated through the National Single Window in over 21 ports. Risk management at customs has been implemented, gradually moving control from border to post border. Once fully implemented, only 19 percent of products will be inspected at the border, significantly less than the current 49 percent.

64,4,"Appendix V. Impact of Fiscal and Other Structural Reforms The IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model is used to estimate the macroeconomic effects of fiscal reforms in Indonesia. GIMF is a multi-country general equilibrium model that includes a detailed specification of fiscal policy, including different taxes (consumption, labor, and corporate) and different expenditure items (government consumption, public investment, general and targeted transfers, and interest payments). The main properties of the GIMF model calibrated for Indonesia are as follows:",FALSE,normal
64,5,"• The multiplier on output from a 1 percent of GDP permanent increase in infrastructure investment is 1 percent in the first year, rising gradually to over 2 percent in 10 years. The rise in the multiplier in the medium term is driven by the increase in private investment, as the higher stock of public capital raises the productivity of private capital.",FALSE,normal
64,6,"• The multipliers on output from a 1 percent of GDP permanent rise in social transfers are modest in the first year, ranging between 0.15 percent for targeted transfers to the poor and 0.05 percent for untargeted general transfers. The medium-term impact is slightly negative as taxes are raised or spending is cut to keep the fiscal deficit unchanged.",FALSE,normal
64,7,"• The multipliers on output in the first year from a 1 percent of GDP permanent rise in revenue due to higher taxes are –0.2 percent for consumption taxes, –0.3 percent for labor taxes, and – 0.5 percent for corporate taxes. The negative impact on output from higher consumption taxes declines over time to nearly zero after 10 years, while that from higher labor taxes rises increases to 0.5 percent in the second year, remaining at that level for the following eight years. The negative impact on output from higher corporate taxes increases gradually over time to 1.5 percent after 10 years. As the GIMF model cannot estimate the impact of other structural reforms directly, these are estimated indirectly in the GIMF model through an estimated impact of these reforms on total factor productivity (TFP). Barnes (2014)1 finds that a benchmark reduction in the product market regulation (PMR) index could increase TFP by around 2 percent over 5 years, with larger gains for emerging market economies. For example, a 10 percent reduction in the PMR index could lead to gains in TFP of about 1.7 percent for BRICS and 1.3 percent for OECD countries. Dabla-Norris and others (2016)2 finds that trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) liberalization, as well as labor market reforms to remove excessive rigidities, can significantly boost TFP in emerging market economies. Moreover, the short-term costs of these reforms are small, while the medium-term benefits are sizable and long lasting. The reform scenario includes higher spending in infrastructure and targeted transfers financed mainly by higher consumption taxes, reduced barriers to trade and FDI, and",FALSE,normal

65,4,"structural reforms to the product and labor markets. About 2 percent of GDP of the extra revenue from the MRTS would come from consumption taxes such as VAT and excises on fuel, vehicles, and plastic bags, which have low negative multipliers. The other 1 percent of GDP would come from taxes with larger negative multipliers. This extra revenue would be used to increase spending in infrastructure (1.3 percent of GDP) and targeted transfers in education, health and social programs (1.5 percent of GDP), which have larger multipliers. Other structural reforms would center on reducing restrictions to trade and FDI, and streamlining product and labor market regulations to promote entry, rationalize the role of SOEs, and foster employment. Most of the gains in real GDP growth in the initial years would come from fiscal reforms, with gains in TFP from other structural reforms playing a role in the outer years. Real GDP growth would increase gradually to 6.5 percent by 2022, 0.9 percentage points higher than the baseline scenario. Higher infrastructure investment and FDI, which would also catalyze private investment and employment, would be the main growth drivers in the first two years, raising real GDP growth by 0.2 percent. Gains in TFP from other structural reforms would raise real GDP growth by 0.1 percent in 2020−21 and 0.2 percent in 2022. Higher public and private investment and employment growth would play an increasing role over time, raising real GDP growth by 0.5 and 0.2 percentage points relative to the baseline by 2022, respectively. The reform scenario also assumes continued macroeconomic stability. Inflation would rise to around 4 percent (y/y) in the initial years due to the demand stimulus and higher consumption taxes, but it would moderate afterwards due to a tighter monetary stance, stronger domestic competition and expanded production capacity. The current account deficit would widen to around 2.3 percent of GDP due to higher public and private investment-related imports (or a lower saving- investment gap in the private sector), which would be partly offset by higher exports due to enhanced competitiveness.",FALSE,normal

77,4,"STATISTICAL ISSUES Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some shortcomings in fiscal and external sector statistics. National accounts: Statistics Indonesia (BPS) disseminates annual and quarterly GDP (QGDP) by economic activity and expenditure components at current prices and in volume terms at 2010 prices regularly. In general, GDP estimates are based on the latest international methodologies following the System of National Accounts 2008. The QGDP estimates are based on a limited set of indirect indicators. Some sectors are influenced strongly by seasonality, with seasonally adjusted data prepared but not published. BPS has been leading the work on developing sectoral accounts and balance sheets jointly with Bank Indonesia (BI) with TA from STA. BPS and BI expect to finalize the provisional data for the years 2010–2014 by the end of 2017. The next TA mission on Sectoral Accounts will be fielded in January 2018. Price statistics: Price statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. The base year for PPI is 2010. The base year for CPI is 2012. In October 2013, BPS released the new Producer Price Index (PPI) covering agriculture, mining and quarrying, and manufacturing with 2010 as the base period, and has published the PPI index quarterly. BPS has also expanded the mining sample to include oil and natural gas extraction, coal, and gold, and has started work to further expand PPI coverage to include 15 service industries. Currently PPI for the following service industries are disseminated: electricity, water and gas; passenger transport; hotel and restaurants. There is a need to increase dissemination frequency and update the weights. Bank Indonesia and BPS have jointly begun work to expand the coverage of the residential property price index (RPPI) to include resales (the current RPPI includes only the sales of newly constructed units). Government finance statistics (GFS): The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is committed to keeping the requirements of fiscal statistics at the forefront of ongoing fiscal reforms, with better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the current efforts. The authorities are continuing their efforts to adopt the GFSM 2001/2014 standards, with assistance from STA as part of a regional GFS project. Significant progress has been made in these areas and, in 2013, Indonesia reported for the first time to STA general government data (including balance sheet data) covering the period 2008 onwards. Aggregated data on the budget of the central government are available with a one-month lag. Annual general government GFS are currently available 12 months after the end of the reference period and these data are published on the GFS website: http://www.gfs.djpbn.kemenkeu.go.id/en. The timeliness of the annual data will improve once all systems are in place. In late 2015, the authorities have started to compile quarterly general government data based on estimates of local government data. Quarterly general government GFS (operations statement) are available 6 months after the end of the reference quarter. The quarterly general government data are yet to be published on the GFS website because the authorities are improving these data in terms of coverage of local governments and timeliness with the development of new regional financial information system. Limited quarterly general government GFS data are published in IFS. The coverage and timeliness of public debt statistics are generally adequate. Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) and financial soundness indicators (FSIs): Good quality monetary statistics are compiled by BI on a timely basis. BI compiles and reports monetary data using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), from which an integrated database and alternative presentations of monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the IMF. Additional challenges include timely revisions of published banking sector data after supervisory verification. With the support of a Fund TA mission in October 2014, BI expanded the coverage of the OFCs survey, which since January 2015 includes finance companies, insurance companies, pension funds, the state-owned pawn shop (PT Pegadaian), and the Indonesian export financing institution (Eximbank); achieving almost full coverage of the subsector. OFC data are reported on a monthly basis. The mission also assisted BI in advancing the production of flow-based monetary statistics and quarterly financial accounts. BI compiles and reports to the Fund all (12) core and 12 encouraged financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for deposit takers, all (two) encouraged FSIs for OFCs, two encouraged FSIs for nonfinancial corporations, one encouraged FSI for households, two encouraged FSIs for market liquidity, and three encouraged FSIs for the real estate sector, which are published quarterly on the Fund’s FSI website. External sector statistics (ESS): Trade data have been improved in recent years. Import and export transactions of free trade zones and bonded warehouses are captured in goods data of balance of payments (BOP) statistics. For financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of direct investment (DI) data needs substantial improvement. Inflows are currently calculated based on loan disbursements to companies that have foreign equity using a fixed ratio to estimate equity inflows. The errors and omissions in BOP has been large and predominantly negative and could be related to the under coverage of imports in current account or assets in the financial account. Financial transactions data are reconciled with changes in the international investment position (IIP), except data on DI. IIP data are compiled and published annually and quarterly. External debt statistics have improved considerably with the introduction of an External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002 and the recent initiative to publish monthly indicators. Also, as a result of the ongoing reconciliation of data conducted by BI, the IIP and external debt data are fully consistent. However, improvements are still needed with respect to components of private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled and actual debt service, in estimating the accumulation/reduction of private sector payments arrears, and in estimating reschedulings/debt reductions received by the private sector from external creditors. Data Standards and Quality Indonesia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September 1996, observing most of the SDDS requirements. Indonesia uses the SDDS flexibility options for the timeliness of the labor market categories (employment, unemployment, and wages/earnings) and general government operations. Data Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was completed in 2005.",FALSE,normal

The authorities would also like to emphasize the importance of a sequential phase to implement structural reform efforts, especially in light of the long-term nature of these reforms.

80,11,"The authorities would like to emphasize that reform progress is not necessarily reflected in the form of market access and/or market price. Indonesia currently continues to implement a wide range of structural reform efforts to ensure economic competitiveness, diversify the source of growth, and improve the social welfare. The implementation of the said reforms would require strategy and finesse including ways to phase out the process whilst taking into account the impact to low-income society. The authorities would like to highlight that the effort to move from product subsidy towards a more targeted subsidy in the energy sector has been progressing very well in an integrated approach. In particular, for fuel subsidy, they have combined the pace of the shift towards pure market-based fuel price with quantitative measures 1 by limiting the volume and availability of gas stations providing subsidized fuel (RON 88), as well as limiting the types of vehicles allowed to consume the subsidized fuel. These efforts have increased the usage of market-based fuel type (i.e. RON 90 and RON 92). Additionally, since the abolishment of fuel subsidy policy, the authorities no longer allocate fuel subsidy fund in the fiscal budget. Thus, the authorities’ effort to ensure smoothness of reform implementation should not be seen as a delay, rather it should be seen as progress in the right direction.",FALSE,normal

The significant progress has been made in expediting infrastructure projects after SOEs played key role in the projects that had been stalled for years under the privates.

The authorities view current monetary policy stance as neutral and will continue to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability. The strategy has allowed the monetary policy to support a more sustainable and inclusive economic growth. They will continue to employ “the policy mix”, namely monetary policy, exchange rate policy, macro-prudential policy, payment system policy, and strong coordination with the government. Looking ahead, the authorities will remain vigilant of global and domestic risk development and will formulate monetary policy accordingly in line with the above-mentioned developments.

This is especially pertaining to consistency between the CA norm and the overall macroeconomic scenario. The authorities view that the estimated CA norm (-1.3 percent of GDP) does not adequately reflect Indonesia’s need of higher CA deficit to finance investment on infrastructure and other structural reforms.

82,7,"On the issue of external debt, the authorities concur with staff assessment that Indonesia’s external debt remains sustainable. Currently, external debt remained moderate at 34.4 percent of GDP (September 2017). They believe that this condition is the result of measures implemented by the authorities to moderate risks from external debt. One such measures is the corporate external debt regulation 2 (KPPK) which requires hedging (at least 25 percent) of net FX liability of corporate with external debt maturing within six months. 3 he authorities view that this prudential regulation has helped curb the rise of corporate external debt and moderate the risks of overall external debt. In the end, the measure has helped improve Indonesia’s resilience toward the external shocks. This corporate external debt regulation was never intended to limit capital flows and is aimed to ensure macro financial stability through the adoption of prudential principle of corporate borrowing, thus it should be categorized as ‘other policies’ and not as a CFM or CFM/MPM. That said, the authorities remain open to conduct a cost-benefit analysis to extend the coverage of the regulation.",FALSE,normal

High capital buffers and strong profitability has also helped to absorb most of credit losses, under the most severe FSAP’s stress tests.
