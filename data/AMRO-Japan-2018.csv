4,5,"1. The Japanese economy continues to grow above its potential, while quarterly GDP fluctuated widely in the first three quarters of 2018. Last year’s highly volatile GDP growth trajectory has been largely driven by one-off factors, such as bad weather and natural disasters. That said, by and large, the economy continues to grow around its potential. Private consumption is picking up, albeit with volatility, supported by increases in household income amid a tight labor market. Business fixed investment remains on a rising trend, backed by strong demand for labor saving types of investment. Exports growth remained positive, while imports continued to see moderate growth. Looking ahead, real GDP is expected to maintain moderate growth of 0.8 percent in FY2018, before easing to 0.7 percent in FY2019.1",FALSE,normal
4,6,"2. Consumer price inflation has continued to rise steadily to 1 percent, broadly approaching the medium-term inflation expectations of households and corporates. However, despite tighter labor market conditions and a positive output gap, core inflation (excluding fresh food and energy) stayed within the 0.2-0.5 percent range during the year. Medium-term inflation expectations hovered around 1 percent. Going forward, consumer price inflation is expected to rise moderately to 0.9 percent in FY2018 and 1 percent (excluding the effects of the consumption tax hike) in FY2019. Given lagged adjustments in wages and goods prices amid low inflation expectations of around 1 percent, it is unlikely that inflation will reach the BOJ’s 2 percent target in the near- to medium-term.",FALSE,normal
4,7,"3. The external position remains strong given the significant current account surplus, supported by large primary income inflows. The current account surplus stayed at between 3 and 4 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 2018. The goods trade balance remained in surplus but narrowed as imports continued to grow faster than exports amid strong business investment and strengthening private consumption. Capital outflows continued to be driven by residents’ outward investments in search of higher returns amid the sizable current account surplus.",FALSE,normal
4,8,"4. The overall financial condition remains accommodative amid very low interest rates, while financial institutions’ core profitability is trending lower. Bank loan growth remained robust at around 3 percent in the second half of 2018. The private non-financial credit- to-GDP ratio stays above its trend. Meanwhile, banks have sufficient capital buffers, while non- performing loan ratios have remained low at around 1 percent. However, the prolonged low interest rate environment and intensified competition among financial institutions continue to depress net interest margins, thereby exerting downward pressure on the banking sector’s core profitability, especially in the case of regional banks, which depend mostly on the domestic lending business.",FALSE,normal
4,9,"5. Fiscal consolidation has lagged behind the schedule and fiscal policy has remained expansionary. The overall fiscal deficit has been reduced, largely driven by strong tax revenue collection owing to robust economic growth and declining interest expense on JGB bonds. Amid continued expansionary fiscal policy, however, the primary deficit of the central and local governments has remained significantly wider than the one in “The Plan to Advance",FALSE,normal

5,5,"6. Downside risks to the near-term outlook have intensified, mainly due to external risk factors with some tail events. These include a further escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflicts, a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in major trading partners, and heightened global uncertainties triggered by a crisis in some emerging markets or geopolitical tensions. Domestically, the scheduled consumption tax hike in October 2019 may cause demand fluctuation, while mitigating measures will be implemented. Structural challenges include demographic headwinds from population aging and low fertility rates, weakening of fiscal discipline, and prolonged easing of monetary policy.",FALSE,normal
5,6,"7. Abenomics should be periodically reviewed and recalibrated, considering the achievements and shortfalls thus far in order to enhance its effectiveness and sustainability in reviving the dynamism of the economy. Abenomics has been successful in lifting the economy’s growth potential, raising inflation expectations to a significantly positive level, containing a further build-up of public debt in terms of GDP, and improving the long-term prospects of the economy. However, the policies have also fallen short of achieving their targets in some areas and have had some unintended consequences on the financial markets. It is therefore a good time for the authorities to take stock of the progress made, and to recalibrate the targets and enhance the effectiveness of the policies.",FALSE,normal
5,7,"8. Fiscal policy should prioritize restoring fiscal sustainability, while effectively addressing the expected short-term negative impact from the scheduled consumption tax hike in 2019. A comprehensive and consistent medium-term fiscal consolidation plan should be formulated, based on macroeconomic scenarios that are realistic. In the near-term, however, supplementary policy measures that have been decided to mitigate the impact of the consumption tax hike in 2019 should be implemented as intended to support consumer sentiments and spending.",FALSE,normal
5,8,"9. The current accommodative monetary policy could be maintained for an extended period, but the policy should be constantly reviewed and recalibrated to maintain its effectiveness and credibility. In particular, a further recalibration of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing with yield curve control, or ‘QQE with YCC’ policy toward more flexibility is recommended to improve market functioning in the JGB markets. The authorities should also enhance its supervision of financial institutions’ risk-taking behavior and the potential build-up of credit risks in light of the continued growth in loans against a backdrop of narrowed interest margins.",FALSE,normal
5,9,"10. Structural reforms focused on tackling demographic challenges should be enhanced and implemented in a credible and bold manner. The authorities’ proactive approach toward ‘Human Resource Development’ and ‘Supply System Innovation’ is commendable. To cope with the challenges of an aging society, creating continued employment opportunities for senior citizens should be a priority, and rigid labor practices under the traditional lifetime employment system need to be changed. The implementation of free early-childcare services should be designed to promote more active labor force participation of women. Embracing foreign workers will also contribute to enhancing the growth potential of the economy and facilitate the demographic transition.",FALSE,normal

6,6,"1. The Japanese economy continues to grow above its potential, while quarterly GDP fluctuated widely in the first three quarters of 2018. Real GDP declined by an annualized 1.3 percent in Q1, reflecting adverse weather conditions, but rebounded in Q2 by 2.8 percent, mainly led by strong business investment and recovering private consumption. However, Q3 GDP contracted by 2.5 percent, largely due to a series of natural disasters, which disrupted production. That said, by and large, the Japanese economy continues to grow above its potential. Private consumption is picking up, albeit with volatility, supported by increases in household income amid a tight labor market. Business fixed investment remains largely on a rising trend, backed by continued expansion in exports and strong demand in labor saving investment. Exports growth remained positive, while imports continued to see moderate growth.",FALSE,normal
6,7,"2. In terms of value-added contribution, exports have become a more important driver of economic growth while the share of consumption has declined. The alternative GDP decomposition, using the import-adjusted method, shows that contribution of exports to value-added GDP has gradually increased from 10 percent in 2000 to 15 percent to 2017 while the contribution of consumption has fallen from 53 percent in 2000-2011 to 47 percent in 2017 (Figure 1). This suggests that exports could remain one of the main drivers of growth in terms of value-added even in the period when net exports in conventional GDP accounting may turn negative due to higher demand for imported goods.",FALSE,normal

Looking ahead, real GDP is expected to maintain moderate growth of 0.8 percent in FY2018, before easing to 0.7 percent in FY2019.2 Buoyant domestic and external demand is expected to drive growth in FY2018 (Figure 2). Growth in FY2019 would be moderate due to the scheduled consumption tax hike in October 2019, negative spillovers from the U.S.-China trade conflicts, and moderating investments with the completion of projects for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.",FALSE,normal

Although payroll employment growth moderated to 2 percent in October after peaking at 2.8 percent in April, overall employment sustained a modest upward trend. Meanwhile, the real wage income of employees continued to improve during the first three quarters of 2018, reflecting higher employment and increases in nominal wages. Scheduled hourly wages for part-timers rose by 2.4 percent in Q3, while scheduled monthly earnings for full-timers increased by 1.2 percent.

Following a slight drop in Q2, CPI (less fresh food) inflation gradually recovered to 1 percent in September and October, due to higher energy and services prices.

The BOJ is of the view that domestic demand will hold up growth with a virtuous cycle from income to spending in private sectors amid highly accommodative financial conditions and supportive government spending. With the recent downward revision in January 2019, the BOJ’s projections are largely in line with those of AMRO. The real GDP forecast is 0.9 percent in FY2018 and 0.9 percent in FY2019.

Meanwhile, in December 2018, the Cabinet Office revised down the GDP growth forecasts to 0.9 percent for FY2018 and 1.3 percent for FY2019, reflecting a sharp drop in the second estimate for Q3 GDP, while adjusting CPI inflation forecasts to 1.0 percent and 1.1 percent in FY2018 and FY2019, respectively.",FALSE,normal

Merchandise export growth declined to 5.1 percent during the first three quarters of 2018 from 11.8 percent in the 2017 full-year. Import growth slowed to 9.1 percent during the same period from 14.1 percent in 2017 while picking up gradually with higher oil prices (Figure 5). After showing a 1.3 percent decline from a year ago in September on account of a severe typhoon, exports rebounded in October by 8.2 percent. Despite slower growth in the export volume to both U.S. and China, adverse impacts of the U.S.- China tariff measures that were already implemented seem to have not substantially materialized yet.",FALSE,normal
8,7,"9. The external position remains strong given the significant current account surplus, supported by large primary income inflows. Of the current account surplus of JPY16.5 trillion in the first three quarters of 2018 (4.1 percent of GDP), net inflows from the primary income accounted for JPY16.9 trillion, reflecting Japan’s large overseas investments. The goods trade surplus remained modest at JPY1.9 trillion, as imports continued to grow faster than exports amid strong business investment and strengthening private consumption.",FALSE,normal
8,8,"10. Capital outflows continued to be driven by residents’ outward investments in search of higher returns amid the sizable current account surplus. Portfolio investment reverted to net outflows of JPY16.2 trillion during the first three quarters of 2018 from net inflows in 2017. Japanese investors purchased foreign stocks and bonds by a net total of JPY17.3 trillion in the period. Foreign investors continued to be net buyers of Japanese bonds, largely on short- term tenures, and net sellers of stocks during the same period. After heightened concerns over global trade conflicts led to a sharp appreciation to the 104-level in Q1, the JPY has been depreciating against the USD, reflecting widening interest rate differentials with the USD assets (Figure 6).",FALSE,normal

Bank loan growth was around 3 percent in Q3 2018, slightly lower than the 3.2 percent growth seen in 2017.3 Loans to corporates grew by 3.4 percent in Q3, while loans to individuals expanded by less than 1 percent. Loans to the real estate sector, meanwhile, grew by 5.7 percent in Q3, but is on a moderating trend. The private non-financial credit-to-GDP ratio remains above its trend (Figure 7), suggesting that the credit cycle continues to be expansionary.",FALSE,normal

Since the introduction of the BOJ’s Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control (YCC) policy in September 2016, the 10-year JGB yield has been anchored at around 0 percent, restoring the positive yield curve. In July 2018, the BOJ recalibrated the ‘QQE with YCC’ policy by allowing the 10-year JGB yield to ‘move upward and downward to some extent’. Since the policy tweak, long-term JGB yields have shown a moderate rise across the board. While stock prices remain broadly supported by strong corporate earnings, volatility has increased recently, mainly due to the U.S.-China trade tension.",FALSE,normal

10,10,"14. Fiscal consolidation has lagged behind the schedule and fiscal policy has remained expansionary. In FY2017, total expenditure amounted to 38.3 percent of GDP (on the basis of the general government), staying at a similar level since FY2015, partly due to ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts. Interest expense continued to decline to 1.8 percent of GDP in FY2017 from 2.1 percent in FY2015 amid prolonged monetary easing (Figure 9). In contrast, total revenue increased to 35.6 percent of GDP in FY2017 with strong tax collection reaching at around 18.9 percent of GDP, mainly due to robust economic growth. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit shrank to 2.7 percent of GDP in FY2017 from 3.4 percent of GDP in FY2016. Amid continued expansionary fiscal policy, however, the primary deficit of the central and local governments has remained significantly wider than the one in “The Plan to Advance Economic and Fiscal Revitalization” announced in 2015 with the target to achieve a primary surplus by FY2020 (Figure 10).",FALSE,normal

In line with AMRO’s assessments, the BOJ listed major upside and downside risks to economic activity, as: i) external developments in global economies such as the U.S. which can impact global financial markets, in addition to protectionism moves; ii) the effect of the consumption tax hike in October 2019; and iii) the prospect of private sector expectations given an aging population and secular changes in labor markets. With regard to the consumption tax hike in 2019, the government stressed that its impact will be limited compared to the last hike in the first place, and besides that there will be government-supported measures to offset adverse effects as shown in Prime Minister Abe’s strong commitment to soften the impact.

Assuming that growth remains in line with potential, fiscal policy needs to emphasize continued fiscal discipline. Reduced interest expense burden from low financing costs remains a tailwind for near-term fiscal management. In the near-term, supplementary policy measures that have been decided should be implemented as intended to lift consumer sentiment and mitigate the impact of the tax hike on private consumption and economic growth. Deploying additional tax revenues from the 2019 consumption tax hike towards free early-childhood education and increased supply of child care centers is highly commendable for improving human capital stock and encouraging further labor force participation of women.

Economic and fiscal projections based on more plausible scenarios will be essential to make the fiscal consolidation plan credible and effective. Setting intermediate indicators on FY2021 would enhance the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation. Additional revenue-raising measures over a longer time horizon need to be articulated and implemented to offset the decline in the revenue base, given the projections that social security-related expenditures will keep rising beyond FY2022 when the first baby boomers begin to turn 75 years-old or more.

The authorities should further supervise financial institutions’ risk-taking behavior and the potential build-up of credit risks accompanied by the continued growth in loans against narrowed interest margins. In particular, special attention is needed to monitor emerging financial risks, especially in the real estate and stock markets as well as inward and outward spillovers (See Selected Issue 4 on Interconnected of Japan’s Mega Banks and its Implications on Cross-Border Spillovers). Closer engagement with regional banks is recommended to address long-term challenges of declining profitability against demographic headwinds and macro risks.

Given that Japan is characterized by a high degree of market geographic division, high cost of financial products and high cash usage, as pointed out by S&P Research, the development of fintech could potentially change the landscape and benefit society through both efficiency gains and cost savings.

21,5,"14 Other related requirements such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML), book-keeping and auditing, possibly help bring virtual currency exchanges under the radar, and the regulators could strike a balance between financial innovation and consumer protection. speedy implementation will create an amiable data sharing economy that will benefit all stakeholders, including fintech companies, banks and eventually the users of financial services (Figure A2). The authorities have also taken the lead in virtual currency regulation, targeting sustainable development of the sector while ensuring consumer protection. While some other countries are still unclear about their policy stance on virtual currencies, Japan has been spearheading a clear compliance framework governing virtual currency exchanges. The amendment of the Payment Services Act, effective on 1 April 2017, recognizes virtual currency as a form of payment and requires the registration of virtual currency exchanges with the Financial Services Agency.14 Meanwhile, regulating Initial Coin Offering (ICO) — which determines the supply factor of virtual currency exchanges, has also been ongoing. However, it could take a longer time to establish the overall regulatory framework. Besides moving forward on regulatory fronts, related stakeholders have been making efforts towards facilitating fintech sector development. For instance, Financial Services Agency’s initiatives such as the FinTech Support Desk and FinTech Proof of Concept Hub have helped facilitate the establishment of fintech startups and supported innovative projects. The BOJ Fintech Center has also enabled the study of fintech in relation to financial services, while BOJ’s collaboration with the ECB is exploring the potential of distributed ledger technology in building financial market infrastructure. Fintech associations have also played a critical role in promoting cooperation and knowledge sharing. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has also been actively trying to attract fintech firms aiming to position Tokyo as a key fintech hub in Asia. Although mass adoption will need more time, the roll out of fintech-related applications has started. On the retail payment settlements front, companies such as LINE Pay have gained increasing popularity in Japan. At the same time, many merchants accept foreign services such as Alipay and WeChat Pay for the use of foreigners. Increasingly, startups have been exploring opportunities in asset management (by providing robo-advisory or online trading platforms), alternative lending, personal finance, accounting and data analytics. Going forward, the associated risks need to be monitored well while developing fintech. Japan’s fintech development has the potential to accelerate the transformation of the financial sector, in particular banking models, raising the economy’s potential growth in the medium term. However, security issues such as consumer protection and regulatory compliance will continue to be a priority while striving for innovation. On the other hand, cross-border regulatory cooperation is also critical in changing domestic regulations to cope with evolving fintech.",FALSE,normal

While subject to new tariffs, Canada and Mexico could be exempt under the USMCA framework once it becomes effective.

While the models estimate that the tariff measures already implemented will have a limited impact on the Japanese economy, it is important to note that the models ignore some additional channels of impact. In the case of Japan, since value added activities have not only come from domestic manufacturers but also from their global investments, investment income is also being redirected to support domestic equity market valuation, household consumption, and corporate capital spending. In 2017, Japan corporates received about USD58.2 billion manufacturing investment income and USD57.9 billion non-manufacturing investment income from overseas (Figure A1.1). Meanwhile, the corresponding figures for China stood at USD11 billion and USD4.5 billion respectively. Such exposure related to the investment abroad could transmit shocks to the domestic economy by (as a first additional channel) affecting household consumption through equity market re-pricing if earnings are expected to be affected, and then – as a second additional channel – changing investment decision with equity market revaluation and rising market uncertainties, amidst the adjustment of external demand expectation. The previously discussed model estimates do not include such channels",FALSE,normal
31,8,"18 Allowing for trade diffusion and long-run adjustments, the GTAP model estimated by the Japan Center of Economic Research suggests the trade tensions will have minimal impact across different scenarios. AMRO estimates based on the Oxford Economics Macro Global Model, which is a Keynesian-type open economy model in the short run, suggests an annual GDP loss of 0.04 percent. The variation in model estimates is largely due to the difference in model setup and parameter estimates. 19 As USD250 billion of U.S. imports from China account for 48.3 percent of all imports from China, a 20 percent tariff increase on USD50 billion and a 10 percent tariff increase on USD200 billion of imports comes to about a 6.3 percent tariff increase for the U.S. imports from China at an aggregate level.

Given that Japanese manufacturers in both China and Japan sell intermediate and capital goods to customers in China, Japanese corporate sales will be indirectly affected by slower demand from manufacturers in China. First, while Japanese manufacturers in China exporting to the U.S. will be directly affected by higher U.S. tariffs on goods imported from China, such exports are limited in value. According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry data, 45 percent of sales revenue of Japanese firms in China came from exports and only 1 percent or USD2.7 billion was shipped to the U.S. in 2016 (Table A1.2). Second, when higher tariffs weigh negatively on China’s exports, manufacturers in China may postpone their investment plans and reduce orders of intermediate inputs, which would affect domestic purchases from Japanese companies manufacturing in China. Third, it could also depress the export performance of Japanese manufacturers, which are selling to China.20 In total, the direct and indirect trade exposure for Japanese manufacturers is estimated to be around USD312 billion by end-2018, potentially being affected by slower U.S. demand for Chinese goods due to higher tariffs as well as slower overall demand in China itself (Table A1.3).

To understand the impact of tariffs on a firm’s revenue and profit, a simulation exercise suggests that manufacturers could face a tradeoff between a loss of market share and a loss of profit.21 The baseline scenario suggests that as a result of higher final costs driven by additional tariffs, dampened demand could reduce both revenue and profitability of manufacturers, and there is a tradeoff between losing more revenue and more profit (Figure A1.2).

Against this backdrop of trade exposure and business performance sensitivity, adversely affected corporate earnings in Japan could weigh on the equity market, which in turn could weigh on consumption through wealth effects. For instance, the Japanese equity market has provided negative year-to-date returns by November 2018, dragged by companies with exposure to China (Figure A1.3). As of late November 2018, the Nikkei’s China- related stocks were down by about 14 percent since January 2018 and losing 6 percent more than the average Nikkei 225 index. As various studies point out, wealth effects from the equity market on consumption could be substantial. Consumer confidence has been trending down in tandem in 2018.

In addition, the expectation of softer demand in China and lower investment returns from China could dampen overall corporate capital spending in Japan, despite the strong capital spending plan. A recent Development Bank of Japan survey showed a very strong capex spending plan in the manufacturing sector in FY18, with a growth rate of 27.2 percent, in comparison to 0.8 percent in the previous year, mainly driven by new car models, R&D, capacity expansion and automation. Although these drivers are mostly structural and not likely affected by short-term factors, the equity re-pricing – due to the adjustment of lower earnings by listed China-related corporates – could dampen investment and some of the planned investment could be sized down, especially that which is related to demand in China (Figure A1.5).",FALSE,normal

In summary, the above two effects on GDP will likely not be negligible in terms of impact, although such a shock on the domestic economy could be partly offset by production relocation (substitution by existing or new overseas production). An exogenous shock as a result of higher tariffs could pass through to the domestic Japanese economy not only through trade linkages but also weigh on domestic consumption and investment through financial market and sentiment channels. Depending on whether companies have the ability to manufacture elsewhere or not and the cost structure of such production, the relocation of manufacturing activities to other countries could potentially provide a buffer and reduce the magnitude of the negative impact (Figure A1.5).

In fact, there could also be a boost to domestic investment in Japan as a result.

36,5,"1. The BOJ’s unconventional monetary policy framework has continued to evolve over the years since its inception in the late 1990s as an attempt to save Japan from a prolonged period of deflation. In April 2013, the BOJ bolstered the policy framework by adopting the Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) Policy, following several policy experiments such as the Zero Interest Rate Policy (February 1999 to August 2000), the Quantitative Easing Policy (March 2001 to March 2006), and the Comprehensive Easing Policy (October 2010 to April 2013). Since its launch, the QQE policy framework has been further recalibrated in response to developments of economic activity and financial market conditions. In January 2016, the QQE policy was strengthened by the introduction of the Negative Interest Rate Policy (NIRP). However, the abrupt decline in JGB yields triggered by financial markets’ misunderstanding of the NIRP resulted in the subsequent introduction of Yield Curve Control (YCC) in September 2016.",FALSE,normal

The ‘QQE with YCC’ policy aims to create an ultra-low interest rate environment to boost demand and to change the adaptive inflation expectations among households and corporates to more forward-looking inflation expectations. To this end, the BOJ has set the overnight policy rate target at -0.1 percent and the 10-year JGB yields at around 0 percent to reduce real interest rates in both short- and long-term yields (the YCC component). Furthermore, the BOJ has been committed to expand the monetary base with asset purchases until the 2 percent price stability target is achieved in a stable manner (inflation-overshooting commitment component) in order to strengthen the forward-looking mechanism in forming inflation expectations.",FALSE,normal

The ‘QQE with YCC’ policy is assessed to be effective in lowering nominal interest rates both in short- and long-ends of the yield curve. Since the adoption of QQE in April 2013, real interest rates were constantly in negative territory. In early 2017, however, short-term real interest rates picked up largely due to the then falling inflation rates, before declining again (Figure A2.1). As intended, lower JGB yields have been transmitted to a further decline in banks’ lending rates for new loans and discounts (Figure A2.2) as well as corporate bond issuance yields, which helped maintain highly accommodative financial conditions.

Although banks’ lending growth has held up modestly at around 2-3 percent, the presence of ample internal funds has limited further demand for corporate loans (Figure A2.3). Even with lower interest rates, Japanese households also prefer to save rather than to borrow. On the growth front, the economy has been expanding since December 2012 and the output gap turned positive with the tightening of the labor market. That said, the direct effects of accommodative financial conditions on boosting domestic demand remained limited. Private consumption, meanwhile, has shown moderate growth, driven mainly by recovering consumer sentiment amid a tightening labor market.

Under the BOJ’s JGB purchase program with the annual target amount of JPY80 trillion, the portfolio rebalancing effect happens when financial institutions are encouraged to shift from safe JGBs to riskier and/ or higher-yielding assets such as loans, stocks and corporate bonds, which will help strengthen financial intermediation and support financial markets.",FALSE,normal

Through the portfolio rebalancing channel, the BOJ’s JGB purchases resulted in a shift in banks’ portfolio from JGBs to riskier forms of lending such as real estate sector loans, but it also led to the accumulation of bank deposits at the BOJ. The BOJ’s JGB purchases did lead to financial institutions’ portfolios rebalancing toward higher-yield assets, as intended. However, financial institutions mainly shifted from JGB holdings to current account deposits at the BOJ, while expanding bank lending and other risky asset investments to lesser extent (Figure A2.5). A decomposition of bank lending to corporates (Figure A2.6) suggests that the real estate sector benefited greatly from accommodative financial conditions. In contrast, bank lending to the manufacturing sector remained modest, probably due to a lack of loan demand.

The interest rate differential between the U.S. and Japan, reflecting the state of the two economies, could be one of the major factors behind the depreciation of JPY (Figure A2.7). Against the background of the steady growth of overseas economies, JPY depreciation has helped to improve Japanese firms’ repatriated yen- denominated profits. Despite not directly being targeted by the ‘QQE with YCC’ policy, JPY depreciation can be assessed to have helped improve corporate earnings (Figure A2.8) and support stock markets, which in turn provided a strong boost for growth momentum.

Through this channel, the BOJ’s ‘QQE with YCC’ policy can reduce real interest rates, which may help to boost growth and raise inflation expectations. Once actual inflation increased together with inflation expectations, people will raise their inflation expectations further, which may push up the Phillips curve eventually. In this channel, long-term inflation expectations usually play a pivotal role as being anchored to the central bank’s price stability target whereas short-term inflation tends to fluctuate with recent inflation performance. If this channel is effective, with the BOJ’s strong inflation-overshooting commitment, inflation expectations could become more forward-looking, which may help raise actual inflation. Against this backdrop, it is essential to examine inflation expectations formation in Japan and then explore how inflation expectations have affected actual inflation since the adoption of the ‘QQE with YCC’ policy.",FALSE,normal

40,4,"13. Inflation expectations in Japan has been formed in a highly adaptive manner, especially in the short-term outlook. It is well established that both short-term and long-term inflation expectations in Japan tend to be more adaptive than in other advanced economies such as the U.S., the Euro area and the U.K. (Nishino et al., 2016). Several inflation expectation indicators from market participants, the general public and bond markets28 suggest that such an adaptive formation tendency is more pronounced in the near-term outlook, while longer-term expectations have been relatively stable. Figure A2.9 illustrates market participants’ short-term inflation expectations (one year ahead). These tend to be more or less adaptive, reflecting the then-actual inflation level which had fallen into negative territory in the early 2000s and 2010s. In contrast, long-term inflation expectations (6-10 years ahead) have stayed at around 1 percent, except in 2003. Remarkably, short-term expectations began to persistently show an upward deviation from actual inflation since 2010, followed by a sharp pick-up in the long-term expectations at the onset of Abenomics and the QQE policy in April 2013, although they have trended down subsequently. Figure A2.10 suggests the Phillips Curve in the conventional form may have shifted up since the adoption of the QQE policy, meaning that inflation expectations were pushed up to some degree.

42,7,"16. The functioning of financial markets has been adversely affected by the BOJ’s active JGB purchases, although it has shown some improvements recently. As in other advanced economies, JGBs have been traded as primary collateral between financial institutions and provided benchmarks for yield curve pricing. However, with the BOJ’s massive purchase of JGBs via the secondary market, key JGB market liquidity indicators such as investors’ JGB transaction volume and the turnover ratio imply that JGB market liquidity deteriorated sharply following the introduction of QQE in April 2013. The JGB market functioning has improved (Figure A2.12) recently through the introduction of more flexible market operations, including allowing the yield to move upward and downward to some extent depending on developments in economic activity and prices, although the number of negative responses from the participants remains higher than that of positive responses concerning the absolute degree of market functioning (Figure A2.13). On the stock market, the BOJ’s continued ETF purchases with an annual quota of around JPY6 trillion may have helped to support stock prices even when market sentiment worsened. However, such massive stock purchases under the ‘QQE with YCC’ policy has resulted in the impairment of the autonomous stock market functioning, while undermining corporate governance.

43,4,"17. Financial institutions have suffered from lower core profitability with tighter interest margins and limited prospects for capital gains from long-term JGBs. Although the ‘QQE with YCC’ policy has contributed somewhat to encouraging financial institutions to increase lending through the interest rate and portfolio rebalancing channels, customer deposits outpaced loan growth from Q3 2015 to Q1 2018 (Figure A2.14). Such a robust supply of savings gave rise to a secular decline in the loan-to-deposit ratio as well as interest margins (Figure A2.15), which reduced the net interest incomes of financial institutions. Furthermore, the BOJ’s government bond purchases have led to a decline in long-term interest rates while limiting the prospects for further capital gains from holding JGBs. This has incentivized long-term institutional investors to increase overseas investments in search of higher returns.

43,5,"18. Financial imbalances may have been building up in some asset markets. Since the launch of QQE policy in 2013, the real estate loan-to-GDP ratio has grown rapidly, going above the long-term trend. Moreover, the stock markets have benefited from high corporate earnings and the BOJ’s policy support with the ETF purchase has remained strong. In the midst of 2018, although the price-to-earnings ratio stayed slightly lower than its historical average, the TOPIX stock price remained higher than the long-term trend. Given that current real estate and stock prices are above their long-term trends, a sharp correction in the asset markets may undermine confidence and lead to financial instability, although the probability of this happening is low.

Following the launch of ‘QQE with YCC’ policy, long-term JGB yields continued to decline across the board, mainly driven by the BOJ’s purchases with its main purpose of achieving the price stability target. Although the introduction of ‘QQE with YCC’ policy prevented the yields from declining further as happened following the NIRP, as of December 2018, super-long JGB yields have declined by more than 1ppt compared to January 2016 (Figure A2.16). Moreover, the ‘forward guidance’ in the ‘QQE with YCC’ policy that was adopted in July 2018 has enabled the maintenance of low interest rates for an extended period.

44,5,"20. The ‘QQE with YCC’ policy has been effective in bolstering growth momentum and inflation expectations. In our assessment, the ‘QQE with YCC’ policy has contributed to lifting potential growth, actual inflation and inflation expectations by maintaining highly accommodative monetary conditions and strengthening bank lending channels. However, efforts to raise inflation up to the price stability target of 2 percent have not been successful thus far. Our analysis suggests actual inflation may begin to respond to long-term inflation expectations to some degree. This highlights the importance of the BOJ’s effective management of long-term inflation expectations, while suggesting the need to pay closer attention to investigating the optimal level of inflation target customized to Japan’s socio-economic structures from the medium- to long-term perspectives.",FALSE,normal

Monetary policy should continue to be reviewed and recalibrated to address issues related to the achievability of the 2 percent inflation target, and adverse side- effects such as the impact on the profitability of financial institutions and the functioning of the financial markets. Achieving the 2 percent price stability target in the near term remains a very challenging task given the structural difficulties – adaptive inflation expectations formation and a weak link between output gap and actual inflation. Prolonged monetary easing policy has impaired the JGB market functioning, financial institutions’ profitability and resulted in some signs of financial imbalances, while the BOJ’s holdings of financial assets have increased to an unprecedented level. In this regard, the current mix of monetary and fiscal policies needs periodic review and recalibration in order to revitalize the economy while securing longer-term policy sustainability.",FALSE,normal

46,9,"2. This is Japanese banks’ fourth wave of overseas expansion. The first wave ran from the mid-1980s until the burst of the asset bubble in the early 1990s. This period saw Japanese banks mainly supporting the rapid expansion in outward direct investments that were triggered by the sharp appreciation of the yen (Lam 2013). Outward FDI surged from just about USD6 billion per annum in 1984-85 to USD50.5 billion by 1990 as the 50 percent appreciation of the JPY/USD in the three years after the Plaza Accord in 1985 eroded the competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers. Also, strong domestic growth – with real GDP growth averaging 5 percent between 1984-1988 – and a shortage of labor, pushed up wages and land prices in Japan, providing an additional incentive for overseas production (Urata, 1993). In contrast to the first, the second wave in the mid-1990s was marked by a sluggish economy and a low interest rate regime, which saw Japanese banks extending U.S. dollar-denominated loans for investment projects in Asia to take part in the region’s rapid expansion (Delios and Keeley, 2001).30 This outward push was halted by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, although it has",FALSE,normal

47,5,"3. The current uptrend in cross-border activity has been motivated largely by the low core profitability of Japanese banks and intensified by the BOJ’s ultra-easy monetary policy. Population aging, sluggish economic growth, persistent deflation and the large surpluses of Japanese corporations’ limited the domestic opportunities for Japanese banks, thus pushing them in their third wave of global expansion through the 2000s. The major Japanese banks weathered the GFC and still had strong balance sheets, which facilitated their push for global expansion. The Japanese banks were drawn to diversify in Asia, with the region’s large financing needs and greater scope for financial inclusion. Following the GFC and particularly from 2010 onwards, while the said factors continue to figure among Japanese banks’ push to expand overseas, it can be said that the fourth wave is additionally motivated by the deleveraging of European banks and the BOJ’s ultra-loose monetary policy. The European banks’ reduction of foreign assets post-GFC gave the Japanese and other local Asian banks an opportunity to increase their market shares. Similarly, the added downward pressure on Japanese banks’ core profitability resulting from the BOJ’s aggressive monetary easing since 2011, has further prompted banks to search for growth areas overseas.",FALSE,normal

Overseas expansion has been an income growth driver for many of the Japanese banks. This is the case for MUFG – Japan’s largest bank – where foreign net interest income, accounting for about 40 percent of the group’s net revenues, has offset the decline in the domestic net interest income in recent years. However, Japanese banks’ large overseas exposure also makes them more vulnerable to funding and credit risks. Given that a sizeable portion of Japanese banks’ operations are funded short-term and that the loan-to-deposit ratio for overseas loans exceeds 100 percent, such as in the case of MUFG, Japanese banks can be more susceptible to higher USD funding costs arising from the policy rate hikes in the U.S. than other foreign financial institutions with a sufficient deposit base.

Nonetheless, ASEAN – which benefits greatly from increased Japanese financing – should not be complacent. The region’s economies need to strengthen their buffers to guard against the risks of tighter global liquidity, including that arising from a potential normalization of the BOJ’s monetary policy, balance sheet stress on Japanese banks at home, and a pullback by Japanese banks from their foreign exposure.",FALSE,normal

In a global network of institutions, mega banks are connected with relatively more institutions in Europe and ASEAN and are increasingly connected with North America.

The three mega financial groups of Japan, namely the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) and the Mizuho Financial Group (MFG), have been at the forefront of the international expansion by Japanese financial institutions. The mega financial groups (‘mega banks’ thereafter) have enormous assets, varied business segments and extensive international networks, which make their overseas outreach possible. Moreover, ultra-loose monetary policy at home serves as a push factor for them to seek higher returns abroad. Among the many asset classes, their gross loans deployed overseas have been growing and taking up an increasing share of their total outstanding loans over time, as shown in Figure A4.1. Perhaps not surprisingly, a by-product of this international expansion would be their exposure to various risks abroad, while transmitting any shock they receive further to domestic and foreign markets.",FALSE,normal

This selected issue studies the interconnectedness of the mega banks in a global context and evaluates their risk spillovers to the world financials and vice versa, by utilizing network and impact analyses. Focusing on credit risk, this study comprises a network analysis, where we construct a financial network between the mega banks and their global counterparts, and an impact analysis, where we quantify the credit loss attributable to the risk transmitting to and from the mega banks34. The network analysis employs a novel measure of interconnectedness, that is, a partial default correlation between any pair of financial institutions, introduced by Chan-Lau et al. (2018). This default correlation, or correlation coefficient of probabilities of default (PD), captures the tendency of two financial institutions defaulting together. It is ‘partial’ because it teases out the influence from any third parties from the broader global financial system and gives rise to a clean financial network, whose topology allows us to shed light on which markets the mega banks are immediately connected to and disproportionately so. The impact analysis employs a regression model to estimate the change in one financial institution’s PD in response to one unit of change in another institution’s PD.

It requires business entities to record loan loss provision based on expected rather than incurred loss. Mathematically, ECL=PD×Loss Given Default (LGD)×Exposure at Default (EAD). In this selected issue, we assume LGD to be 60 percent, a common assumption used in credit default swap pricing, and EAD to be the total liability of the ‘risk receivers’. Accordingly, the ECL in this context is the credit loss that the ‘risk receivers’ are likely to contribute to the broader financial system, i.e. institutions and depositors that they owe liabilities to, after being affected by the deteriorating credit quality of the ‘risk senders’. 36 The PDs in the analyses are projected values based on the model introduced in Chan-Lau et al.

The two lines should more or less overlap if the mega banks are evenly connected to the rest of the world. For the longest time, however, institutions in ASEAN are over-represented in Japanese mega banks’ peripheral communities, that is, the red line is above the black line. Among others, geographical proximity, Japanese manufacturers’ active involvement in ASEAN, and mega banks’ expansion of subsidiaries/ branches/stakeholding in the region (see Table A3.1 in Selected Issue 3) may help explain this. Japan is a big creditor to many European countries, and therefore it is perhaps not surprising that its mega banks may affect and be affected by credit risk movements in that continent.

While the network analysis in the previous subsection just shows the connection of possible spillovers, the impact analysis 38 in this subsection estimates the magnitude of possible spillovers – credit impairment an institution is likely to incur in the case of another experiencing deteriorating credit quality. Specifically, we do a regression for each institution of its PD on the PDs of all other world financials. These regressions, with about 2,000 independent variables each, are to control for any possible source of risk transmission within the global financial system and are made possible through a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approach, which tackles high-dimensional data by suppressing the minuscule coefficients to zero. The non-zero coefficient on each regressor translates into the PD increase of the ‘risk receiver’ provided the PD of the ‘risk sender’ rises by one unit, everything else being equal. With the estimated coefficients and the assumption on PD movements of the ‘risk senders’, we multiply a 60 percent loss given default and the total liability of the ‘risk receiver’ to proxy for its contribution of expected credit impairment to the financial system, our spillover measure.39",FALSE,normal

In the adverse scenario, we assume the PDs of mega banks’ global counterparties to rise by 10bps, which is to keep many of them in the investment grade (see Table A4.1). In this case, the expected credit loss the mega banks are to incur in June 2018 is estimated to include impact of USD5.5 billion from North America, USD28.2 billion from ASEAN, and USD163.3 billion from Europe. In a severely adverse scenario, we assume the counterparties’ PD to rise by 20bps, sending more of them to speculative grade. In this case, the shock from Europe doubles to USD326.7 billion, significant enough to consume the entire common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) of the three mega banks, or about 10% of their total asset.

56,11,"9. This selected issue presents an approach to analyzing a risk transmission channel in a global context. Capturing interconnectedness among world financials can be challenging. Ideally, one would expect to gather information on the flow of funds under different asset classes across institutions and then analyze whether any shock hitting one institution is likely to ripple through the system and in what form. Authorities may have these data for their jurisdictions, but for cross-border exposures, especially if indirect or time-sensitive, it might be difficult for them to collect them in a complete and timely manner. The interconnectedness in this study presents a way to capture how the financial distress of institutions interplays with each other. With a single statistical measure, it yields implications on how risk transmits and how credit loss is associated.",FALSE,normal

Through the direct risk transmission channels, the mega banks’ outward spillover is marginal, whereas the inward spillover to them is substantial. This is likely because they are net creditors to the world, and therefore more likely to receive rather than export credit risk.

To address the issue, several measures will be adopted soon including creating new visa status for skilled foreign workers and encouraging foreign students to work in Japan after their graduation.

58,5,"1. Labor shortage has been and will increasingly be one of the most pressing structural issues in Japan that could undermine its long-term growth potential. Japan is aging rapidly amid a decline in population given the low fertility rate. Japan’s population is estimated to decline by 4 percent to 121 million in 2030 from 127 million in 2018, and further by 14 percent to 109 million by 2050. According to the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW), there were only 946,065 births in 2017, the lowest since official statistics began in 1899, while there were up to 1,340,397 deaths. This means that population declined by over 390,000 in one year. Given this large decline in population, the working age population has been affected and is on a declining trend. Working population has started decreasing since late 1990s - from a peak of 87 million to 75.4 million in August 2018, and is expected to fall further going forward. This has resulted in severe labor shortage, although increase in participation rate of female and elderly workers has partly filled the gap. In fiscal year 2019, Japan’s labor shortage is estimated to be at least 600,000, while it is estimated that the shortage could reach 1.30 to 1.35 million41 in the next five years. Labor shortage has affected the quality of service, especially in personal consumption area such as long waiting times in supermarkets or restaurants. The decline in service quality can be regarded as an increase in real prices, although the price tags have remained unchanged42.",FALSE,normal
58,6,"2. Although Abenomics has improved growth potential recently, it has also brought more pressure on the labor market. With the implementation of the three arrows of Abenomics, increase in female and elderly labor participation has partly contributed to higher potential output. Female labor force participation rate has risen and reached 53.2 percent in October 2018 from a low of 47.3 percent in January 2012, while elderly labor force participation improved to 25.2 percent from 19 percent in the same period. These developments have helped to boost GDP growth since 2012. Production index across industries rose in 2018 and created more job opportunities, but this has increased pressure on labor shortage.

Moreover, according to a survey by the Ministry of Finance, 71 percent of Japanese companies, ranging from large enterprises to small and medium-sized businesses, responded that they were short of workers44. Construction sector is estimated to be short of between 780,000 and 930,000 workers, agriculture 103,000, and nursing care 550,000.

Japan’s foreign population accounted for about 2 percent45 of total population in June 2018, which is far less than that in other OECD countries46. In the U.K. and in Germany, the proportion of foreign nationals in total population is 8 and 9 percent, respectively. Although it has increased lately, the number of foreign workers in Japan is still low, at just 1.28 million in October 2017, accounting for just 1 percent of its total population. Manufacturing sector has absorbed the largest share of foreign workers (about 30 percent of total foreign workers registered in the country), followed by wholesale and retail, and hospitality and accommodation, which accounted for 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Surprisingly, nursing care, the most needed services for this aging society, accounts for only 2 percent of total foreign workers (Figure A5.1). Thus, the shortage of labor in this sector could become even more acute, given the rapid population aging.

60,4,"5. To address this acute labor shortage, authorities have started to take steps to open its labor market for foreign labor. Japan already has a framework to accommodate foreign workers. Like other advanced economies, Japan is more open to the admission of high-skilled workers by providing work visas, but less to low-skilled workers. Since 1993, foreign trainees have been brought into Japan under the Technical Intern Training Program, and by October 2017, roughly 20 percent of total foreigners working in Japan were registered under this scheme (Figure A5.2). Officially, under this program, accepted foreign trainees from developing countries come to Japan to acquire job skills and are allowed to remain in Japan for a non-renewable stay of up to five years. Hence, this program does not aim to allow low- skilled workers to stay on a long-term basis, and thus does not provide a permanent solution to mitigate the severity of labor shortages, in particular, in the low-skilled segment.",FALSE,normal
60,5,"6. A move to accept more foreign workers has been adopted to ease the labor shortage. In June 2018, the government issued the Basic Policy on Economic and Fiscal Management Reform to ensure sustainable economic growth by overcoming the low birth rate and declining workforce. The policy lays out key issues to be addressed, including realization and expansion of the human resources development revolution, the promotion of work-style reform, and noticeably, the acceptance of human resources from overseas to solve the intensifying labor shortage issue. On this note, a new bill was passed allowing authorities to accept more foreign workers under a new residency status policy by creating two new visa categories for skilled workers in industrial fields, which will become effective in April 2019. The first type of new visa status applies to workers with certain expertise and skills in industrial fields who meet skill and language minimum requirement and are allowed to stay for up to five years without family accompanying. The second category applies to proficient-skilled workers in industrial fields with permission to bring their families and they are allowed to extend their stay with indefinite renewal. The new policy aims to bring in about 345,000 skilled foreign workers in the next five years, with 47,000 in FY2019. Fourteen industries that are witnessing severe labor shortage, including construction, nursing care, lodging and hospitality, agriculture, and shipbuilding were chosen for this new policy. Government hopes to bring in about 40,000 workers in construction by 2025, 26,000-83,000 in agriculture, 53,000 in restaurants, and about 60,000 in nursing care47.",FALSE,normal

The government also decided to develop the status of residence to expand the field where foreign students can work in Japan after graduation from university by amending a public notice around March 2019, as stated in “Comprehensive Measures for Acceptance and Coexistence of Foreign Nationals”. The number of international students reached 277,331 in 2016, of which only 30 percent of them managed to find a job in Japan after graduation. This figure is well below that of the",FALSE,normal

According to a survey by the International Institute for Management Development, Japan ranks 29th among 63 countries in term of being attractive to foreign talented staff. Its low ranking resulted from relatively low public expenditure on education as well as human development and investment, while Japanese firms’ lack of eagerness to attract and retain talent and senior officials’ lack of international experience in the corporate sector also pulled down its position.",FALSE,normal
61,5,"8. Although accepting more foreign workers is seen as a welcome and immediate measure to address severe labor shortage, the level of openness seems limited in mitigating the challenge. According to a study, increasing immigration to increase labor force in Japan by 1 percent would increase growth potential by 0.15 percent point over 10 years48. Thus, opening up more in this regard can increase the labor supply and enhance the growth potential. However, the new policy of creating new visa status for foreign workers may have only limited capacity to reduce the pressure on labor shortage, given that a significant number of the 340,000 foreign workers that authorities aim to bring in, will be taken up by the conversion of intern trainees who are already residing in Japan. In the meantime, the government’s foreign labor inflow target is far lower than the total shortage across industries, while the increase in participation by the locals, especially that of female and elderly, is likely to reach the limit.",FALSE,normal

It is increasingly difficult to attract foreign workers in light of higher wage increases in Asia and given the prevailing conditions in Japan. To improve the attractiveness, one possible consideration could be to loosen the entry requirement such as the minimum level of Japanese language required. In addition, creating more favorable condition and environment for living and working, including social security system, for foreign workers which is comparable to Japanese peers, would also improve the attractiveness, while maintaining the prevailing measures aimed at increasing female and elderly participation.",FALSE,normal
