4,5,"Executive Summary The Indonesian economy has been resilient against external headwinds, as growth is expected to remain robust and inflation contained in 2018. Recent policy mix recalibration with the implementation of “pre-emptive, front-loading, and ahead-of-the-curve” measures have focused on maintaining stability while supporting growth. Continued pro-active policy mix recalibration is hence recommended in light of rising external risks going forward. 1. Indonesia’s economic fundamentals remain robust with growth projected to continue picking up in 2018. Real GDP grew at 5.1 percent in 2017, led by public investment and commodity exports, amid stable consumption. Growth momentum continued to gather pace in the first half of 2018, with GDP growth increasing from 5.1 percent in Q1 to 5.3 percent in Q2 2018, respectively, supported by sustained investment and strengthened consumption, the latter reflecting higher real wage growth and increased social assistance disbursement. Real GDP growth is expected to be around 5.2 percent in 2018.",FALSE,normal
4,6,"2. Inflation is expected to be contained within Bank Indonesia’s target band of 3.5±1 percent in 2018. Headline CPI averaged 3.8 percent in 2017, as increases in administered prices were partially offset by lower food inflation. In the absence of strong demand-driven inflationary pressures, both headline and core inflation slowed to 3.2 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in July 2018. The authorities have rolled out measures to keep inflation under control in 2018, including stabilizing food prices and keeping subsidized energy prices stable, which has contained the impact of rising global oil prices.",FALSE,normal
4,7,"3. The current account deficit is expected to widen in 2018, driven by imports of raw materials and capital goods, as well as higher oil prices. To contain rising oil imports, the government has strengthened and broadened the implementation of the 20-percent biodiesel mix (B20) policy. Other measures to keep the current account deficit within the threshold of 3 percent of GDP, including the review of imports related to State-Owned- Enterprises (SOEs) and infrastructure projects, are also under consideration.",FALSE,normal
4,8,"4. Reflecting risk aversion towards emerging markets (EMs) stemming from rising uncertainty in the global economy, Indonesian bond and equity markets experienced a sell-off in H1 2018 and the external position came under pressure. In the government bond market, the share of foreign holdings declined from a peak of 40.3 percent in January to about 37.1 percent in July, while the 10-year government bond yield rose to around 7.8 percent, about 150 basis points higher (year-to-date, as of end-July). Net capital outflows also intensified in the stock market in tandem with a significant decline in the Jakarta Composite Index. In response to the latest episode of heightened risk aversion towards EMs, Bank Indonesia raised its key rates four times in May-August 2018, by a total of 125 basis points. Financial markets have responded positively to this “pre-emptive, ahead of the curve, and front-loading” policy action, as foreign investors have returned to Indonesian markets from July 2018. To offset the negative impact of those rate hikes on domestic credit and growth, BI has eased macroprudential policies related to mortgage rules to support the housing market.",FALSE,normal
4,9,"5. The official foreign reserves declined in early 2018 but remain adequate. Amid relatively large capital flow reversal, Bank Indonesia has conducted interventions in both the forex and bond markets to minimize excessive volatility of the rupiah. Against these backdrops, the official foreign reserves declined from a peak of USD130.2 billion at end-2017 to USD118.3 billion in July 2018, which is equivalent to about 7.0 months of imports or 6.9 months of imports and debt service payments.",FALSE,normal
4,10,"6. The banking sector has maintained strong capital buffer with improved asset quality and sustained profitability. Domestic credit has picked up steadily since early 2018, led by working capital and consumption loans. While investment loans remain subdued, firms have increasingly tapped into domestic and overseas capital markets for medium- and long- term financing.",FALSE,normal
4,11,"7. The fiscal deficit is expected to narrow to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2018, reflecting an improvement in revenue. Budget realization in H1 2018 suggests that revenue has",FALSE,normal

5,5,"strengthened and budget deficit has narrowed. Fiscal policies have focused on maintaining stability, aiming to enhance medium- and long-term growth prospects and build up cushions against external shocks. The commendable 2019 Macro-Fiscal Framework and Medium-Term Fiscal Objectives for 2020-2022, which seeks to strengthen the fiscal position with revenue- enhancing measures and continued prioritization of expenditure towards infrastructure investment, has been submitted to the Parliament for approval.",FALSE,normal
5,6,"8. Risks to the downside have risen, stemming mainly from the external environment. Notably, risks of capital flow volatility have increased as global financial conditions have tightened amid heightened uncertainty over global trade policies, triggering risk aversion among investors toward emerging markets, including Indonesia. The implication of capital flow reversal on Indonesia could be significant, considering its reliance on external financing in the capital market, reflecting a narrow base of domestic long-term institutional investors. In addition to indirect spillovers through financial markets, escalating trade conflicts between the U.S. and China may directly affect Indonesia via trade channels, although the magnitude of such impacts is likely to be small, due to Indonesia’s lower trade openness relative to regional peers.",FALSE,normal
5,7,"9. Rising oil prices could widen further Indonesia’s current account deficit. Indonesia has become increasingly reliant on oil imports in tandem with its shrinking oil output, which reflects the ongoing depletion of oil fields and lack of investment and exploration, while demand growth remains solid in recent years.",FALSE,normal
5,8,"10. On the fiscal front, while the state-owned oil company Pertamina has borne the burden of stabilizing subsidized fuel prices thus far, the cost would eventually be shouldered by the budget, especially if oil prices continued to rise. A relatively low tax revenue to GDP ratio, meanwhile, remains the key challenge to Indonesia’s fiscal position in the medium to long-term.",FALSE,normal
5,9,"11. Pro-active calibration of the policy mix is necessary to maintain stability while supporting growth. AMRO welcomes the authorities’ priority toward stability and their readiness to consider further pre-emptive measures, should risks to stability continue to build up. AMRO also welcomes BI’s commitment to maintain exchange rate flexibility while conducting judicious interventions to mitigate extreme volatility. To reduce Indonesia’s susceptibility to external shocks in the long term, ongoing efforts to deepen the domestic financial markets and broaden the domestic investor base, as well as to strengthen financial literacy and inclusion, are recommended.",FALSE,normal
5,10,"12. Ongoing fiscal reforms on both revenue and expenditure fronts are commendable and should be continued. AMRO welcomes the recent focus on revenue- enhancement measures, such as broadening the tax base, reducing exemptions, and improving tax compliance. AMRO also supports the Medium-term Fiscal Objectives for 2020- 2022, and encourages the authorities to continue consolidating current spending, especially non-priority items, to make room for capital spending and other growth-enhancing expenditure. As budget execution of local governments has improved in tandem with fiscal decentralization, further efforts to channel expenditure towards capital spending are recommended. In a related note, energy subsidy reforms should be continued so that more fiscal resources can be channeled to finance needed infrastructure projects, while targeted assistance could be provided to vulnerable groups during the transitional period.",FALSE,normal
5,11,"13. Further structural reforms to realize Indonesia’s long-term potentials are highly recommended. A series of economic policy packages to strengthen the investment climate and enhance competitiveness have contributed to Indonesia’s recent improvements in the Ease of Doing Business ranking by the World Bank and sovereign rating upgrades by the S&P, followed by Fitch Rating and Moody’s. Further efforts to diversify the economy and export structure, including by shifting global value chains participation towards export-oriented industries, are recommended. AMRO welcomes the recent boost in infrastructure investment to enhance connectivity and crowd in private investment. Continued reforms to strengthen competitiveness in the areas of labor skills and local supportive industries are also encouraged.",FALSE,normal

6,7,"1. Real GDP growth picked up modestly to 5.1 percent in 2017, with growth gathering momentum gradually led by public investment and commodity exports. Domestic consumption grew at 4.6 percent in 2017, after bottoming out a year earlier, supported by resilient household consumption and a recovery in public spending. Investment expanded at 6.2 percent – the fastest pace since 2013, led mainly by public infrastructural projects, and to a lesser extent, nascent recovery of private investment in the mining sector.

Real GDP grew by 5.1 percent and 5.3 percent in Q1 and Q2 2018, respectively, with the support of sustained investment and strengthened consumption (Figure 1). Strengthened domestic demand induced broad-based increases in imports, while exports were restrained by a weaker demand for several commodities, namely crude palm oil in key markets such as India and EU1, amid limited price increases. High-frequency household consumption indicators2 have picked up from a stagnant Q1, reflecting higher real wages 3 and increased social assistance disbursement. In addition, spending related to regional elections in June, the Asian Games in August, and the IMF/WB annual meetings in Bali in October, is expected to support stronger domestic consumption in subsequent quarters in 2018.

Headline CPI averaged 3.8 percent in 2017, as increases in administered prices were partially offset by lower food inflation. In light of well-anchored inflation expectation and a base effect of high inflation in H2 2017, both headline and core CPI slowed to 3.2 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in July 2018 (Figure 2). The Government and Bank Indonesia agreed on five measures to keep inflation under control in 2018, including stabilizing volatile food prices, in particular rice. To support the recovery in household consumption, the government has also committed to keep subsidized energy prices, including electricity and fuel, stable in 2018-20194 , which has contained the impact of rising global oil prices. Upside risks to inflation could emanate from rising global oil prices when energy subsidy reforms resume in the future.

7,7,"4. Indonesia’s external position improved in 2017, which allowed Bank Indonesia to build up its foreign reserves to an all-time high of USD130.2 billion by the year-end. The overall balance of payments surplus benefited from rebounding exports and strong capital inflows. Despite a strong recovery in imports, robust exports of Indonesia’s key commodities, including crude palm oil, coal, rubber, and base metals, supported by higher prices and stronger demand, particularly from China, India, and ASEAN, helped contain the current account deficit at 1.7 percent of GDP in 2017 (Figure 3). The financial account surplus was sustained by robust FDI inflows and portfolio investment into the domestic bond market. As a result, the overall balance of payments registered a surplus of USD11.6 billion in 2017, following a surplus of USD12.1 billion in 2016. The gross international reserves increased to an all-time high of USD130.2 billion, as at end-2017, equivalent to more than 8 months of imports of goods and services.",FALSE,normal
7,8,"5. While rebounding exports strengthened the external position in 2017, the current account deficit is expected to widen in 2018 in tandem with rising imports stemming from increased economic activities. The current account deficit has widened to above 2 percent of GDP since Q4 2017, driven by a narrowing trade surplus. Higher oil prices have widened the oil and gas trade deficit, while the non-oil and gas trade surplus has narrowed on the back of rising imports related to increased consumption and investment, in line with increased economic activity, amid moderating export growth. According to AMRO staff’s projections, the current account deficit would widen in 2018 but within Bank Indonesia’s threshold of 3 percent of GDP.",FALSE,normal

As the U.S. dollar strengthened and global risk aversion heightened on the back of market expectations of more aggressive Fed rate hikes, amid rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China, investors reduced their holdings of emerging market (EM) assets, including Indonesian bonds and equities. In the local currency (LCY) government bond market, the share of foreign holdings declined from 40.3 percent in January to 37.1 percent in July5, while the 10-year government bond yield rose to around 7.8 percent, about 150 basis points higher (year-to-date, as of end-July). Net capital outflows also intensified in the stock market in tandem with a decline in the Jakarta Composite Index. As such, portfolio investment reversed from net inflows of about USD2 billion in Q4 2017 to net outflows of about USD1.2 billion in Q1 2018, and preliminary data suggest continued outflows in Q2 2018.",FALSE,normal

8,10,"7. The official foreign reserves declined in early 2018 but remain ample. Amid relatively large capital flow reversal, Bank Indonesia has intervened to reduce excessive volatility in the rupiah exchange rate. At the same time, Bank Indonesia (BI) has purchased government bonds in the secondary market, conducted term repo operations with banks, and conducted forex swap auctions with increased frequency, to ensure sufficient rupiah liquidity. Against these backdrops, the official foreign reserves declined from USD130.2 billion at end- 2017 to USD118.3 billion in July 2018 (Figure 4). In terms of import cover, the latest reserves level is equivalent to about 7.0 months of imports or 6.9 months of imports and debt service payments. According to AMRO’s simplified scenario exercise, a shock similar to what happened during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) could lead to a net capital outflow of about 2.6 percent of GDP and draw down the official foreign reserves by about USD28 billion. Even in this extreme scenario, FX reserves would still be adequate at about USD102 billion, which is well above the conventional metrics of 3 months of imports and within the IMF’s Assessment of Reserves Adequacy (ARA) of 100-150 percent (Annex 1).",FALSE,normal

Revenue collection increased by 7 percent in 2017 from a year earlier, corresponding to about 96 percent of the revised budget, supported by stronger oil and gas- related revenue, which increased by 64 percent during the same period. In addition to a one- off increase to the budget revenue mostly in 2016, the tax amnesty (TA) program reportedly has helped broaden the tax base from 201713. As far as budget expenditure is concerned, expenditure realization in 2017 increased by 7.5 percent from a year earlier, and was equivalent to about 93 percent of the revised budget. Expenditure was rationalized to prioritize growth-support spending, including capital expenditure, regional transfers, as well as social spending. Subsidy spending remained under control, as the increase in fuel subsidies was fully offset by lower electricity and non-energy subsidies (Figure 9). The net impact of higher fuel prices on the budget was positive in 2017. Against these backdrops, budget deficit was about 2.5 percent of GDP in 2017, unchanged from 2016 and lower than the revised target of 2.9 percent.

LGs have increased their expenditure substantially, with greater autonomy in allocating their spending as the CG switched from earmarked grants to a block grant system. This has led to an increase in LGs’ capital spending, from an average of about 22.8 percent of total spending in 2011, to almost 25 percent in 2016, while operational spending has remain dominant.

In light of still-significant demand for infrastructure financing in the coming years, development of innovative financing instruments, such as limited concession schemes (LCS), in addition to securitization – revenue-backed vehicles issued by limited mutual funds (locally known as RDPT), and IDR-linked global bonds (Komodo bonds) issued by domestic corporations, will be further explored (Box A). Box A. Infrastructure Financing in Indonesia As of end-May 2018, 222 National Strategic Projects (PSNs) and 3 programs form the backbone of the authorities’ infrastructure drive, worth around US$303.1 billion15. The current infrastructure development program can be traced back to 2016, when the authorities designated 225 infrastructure projects as PSNs as well as one electricity generation program (building 35 GW of electricity production capacity) as a key imperative, at an estimated cost of US$216.8 billion. Most of these projects involve road and dam construction, as well as creation of special economic zones (SEZs) and industrial zones, with the rest spanning from train networks and airports to clean water facility development. Since then, some projects were eliminated from the PSN list due to milestones not being met, while a number of new projects and two programs (on aircraft development and economic equality) were added to the list, which currently consists of 222 PSNs.16,17 Geographically, most of the projects are in Java (87 projects) and Sumatra (53 projects), which would absorb USD72.3 billion and USD39.7 billion, respectively. Bali & Nusa Tenggara (13 projects) and Sulawesi (25 projects) are the regions with the lowest allocations of infrastructure investment, at US$0.7 billion and US$24.1 billion, respectively. The three programs, however, are nation-wide, as are twelve projects, both of which are estimated to cost around US$98.8 billion. Out of US$303.1 billion of infrastructure spending, the private sector is expected to provide the bulk of the financing, approximately US$178.8 billion, or 59 percent of total financing requirements. SOEs are the second most important source of funding, estimated at US$92.9 billion, or 31 percent of the total costs, while the rest, US$31.3 billion, or 10 percent of the total costs, is borne by the central and regional government budgets.18 In terms of realization, from 2016 until end- May this year, around 72 percent of the funding was provided by the private sector (Figure A1). Going forward, however, the private sector’s share is projected to decline to around 50-55 percent as SOEs and central and regional governments expend greater financial resources on PSNs and the three programs (Figure A2). As far as progress is concerned, as of end-2017, 30 projects had been completed, with a total investment value of USD7.0 billion. Meanwhile, 37 projects and the electricity generation program are currently under construction and partially operating, with an estimated total investment value of USD109.5 billion. With regard to the electricity generation program, only two percent of the planned capacity has been completed so far and operating, while 43 percent is under construction and is set to be finished by 2019-2020.19 Meanwhile, the aircraft development program is in the preparation phase.

Due to the rugged terrain of eastern Indonesia, medium-size aircraft (for 80-100 passengers) is best suited for the region, but lack of availability of such aircraft in the commercial aircraft market has prompted the authorities to promote for the initiative to develop medium-size aircraft domestically. 17 The economic equality program addresses issues related to agrarian and land reform. 18 In addition to funding infrastructure investment directly from the budget, the government also injects capital into SOEs, allowing them to use additional equity to increase leverage. (Capital injection transactions are recorded below the line in the central government budget.) 19 In terms of proprietorship, projects by PLN constitute 33 percent of electricity production. IPPs (independent power producers), which could be domestically- or foreign-owned, account for 55 percent; PLN simply buys electricity from these producers, who generally bear all financial risks (such as exchange rate risk). Lastly, PPP projects account for 12 percent of production, with risks shared between the private sector and the government (not PLN); for example, the government shoulders exchange rate risk by guaranteeing USD amounts of revenue for the private sector.",FALSE,normal

14,8,"18. Risks of capital flow volatility have risen as global financial conditions tightened amid heightened uncertainty over global trade policies. Recent studies suggest that the sensitivity of capital flows into emerging markets to US monetary policies has increased significantly since the GFC21. Most notably, strong U.S. economic data this year have triggered a more aggressive Fed rate hike pathway and risk-off sentiments among investors. In addition, other advanced economies, such as the Eurozone, have started the normalization talk. These developments, coupled with escalating trade conflicts between the U.S. and China, will continue to plague global financial markets with rising volatility and risk aversion, and more episodes of capital flow reversal among EMs, including Indonesia. The impact of capital flow reversal on Indonesia could be significant, considering its high reliance on external financing in the government bond market, reflecting a narrow domestic investor base. In particular, in the government bond market, despite some decline in early 2018, foreign ownership of IGBs has remained at about 38 percent of total bonds outstanding – the highest level among regional economies. In comparison, foreign ownership of government bonds in Malaysia and Thailand were 29 percent and 16 percent, respectively, as at end-2017 (Figure 11). In addition, domestic long-term institutional investors, namely insurance and pension funds, have established a strong presence in the domestic capital markets in Malaysia and Thailand. During episodes of severe capital outflows, these domestic investors could repatriate their overseas funds, or mobilize domestic funds, to support the domestic markets. In contrast,",FALSE,normal

As China and the U.S. – Indonesia’s largest trading partners22, have become increasingly important in recent years, any decline in economic activity in these economies due to the recent escalation of trade tensions could lead to lower demand for Indonesia’s exports. Indonesia’s industries and firms that have participated in global value chains (GVCs) could be adversely affected should trade conflicts lead to disruptions to those GVCs. However, the impact via trade channels could be less severe for a domestic-oriented economy like Indonesia, in comparison with regional peers that have higher trade openness. An analysis of GDP composition by expenditure using the import-adjusted technique 23 suggests that Indonesia has remained a largely domestic demand driven economy, with domestic demand playing an increasingly dominant role in tandem with a declining share of exports (Figure 12). According to AMRO’s latest study which estimates the spillover impact of the U.S. – China trade war scenario using GVAR model, Indonesia is found to be among the least affected, while Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam could be affected more significantly.24",FALSE,normal

Meanwhile, ASEAN as a whole accounted for an aggregate of 23.3 percent. 23 In determining the sources of growth, the conventional approach is to use private consumption, investment, public consumption, and net exports as a share to GDP. The limitation of this approach, however, is that it is not representative if the true relative contribution of domestic and external demand in driving growth, as imports that help satisfy domestic demand are not netted out from domestic demand, overstating the true impact of domestic demand on domestic value added. The import-adjusted methodology, or input-output cumulative production structure (CPS) technique, estimates the import content of the goods and services associated with each component of final demand for the economy.

The policy mix concept embraces the close coordination among Bank Indonesia, Ministry of Finance, OJK, and other relevant government agencies in formulating macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability in the short term, while enhancing growth prospects in the long term. In light of contained inflationary pressure and financial stability risks, Bank Indonesia lowered its policy rates in 2016-2017 to support domestic economic activity, relaxed the loan-to-value (LTV) regulations to support the housing market, as well as recalibrated its macroprudential measures related to reserve requirements to provide flexibility in banks’ liquidity management. In the fiscal sector, the government successfully pushed through the Tax Amnesty program and reforms in energy subsidies. On structural policies, the authorities have implemented a number of economic policy packages to improve the business climate and strengthen competitiveness31. Most recently, the government has increased tax holidays for a wider range of important sectors and industries in the economy, as well as launched the Online Single Submission (OSS) – a web-based platform that integrates all business licensing, and enable the simultaneous issuance of permits (at both central and regional government levels) (Table 1). These efforts have contributed to recent enhancements in Indonesia’s economic fundamentals and institutional framework, as evident in its improvement in Ease of Doing Business ranking32, and sovereign rating upgrades, first by S&P in May 2017 and followed by Fitch Rating in December 2017 and Moody’s in April 201833 .

Most recently, the Government issued two (revised) regulations in April 2018 to streamline the procedure of visa application for foreign workers and to revise the current tax incentive scheme to promote investment and exports in a number of pioneer industries. 32 Indonesia’s overall ranking in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business improved from the 91st place in 2017 to the 72nd place in 2018, out of a sample of 190 countries and territories. 33 S&P Global Rating upgraded Indonesia to investment grade in May 2017, Fitch Ratings upgraded Indonesia one notch above the investment grade in December 2017, and Moody’s upgrade followed in April 2018.",FALSE,normal

19,6,"27. The current fiscal reform is appropriately aimed at strengthening the fiscal position and supporting economic growth. The authorities should continue to focus on revenue-enhancement measures, such as broadening the tax base, reducing exemptions, and improving tax compliance. AMRO supports the Medium-term Fiscal Objectives for 2020-2022, and encourages the authorities to continue consolidating current spending, especially non- priority items, to make room for capital spending and other growth-promoting expenditure. As budget execution at local governments has improved with fiscal decentralization, further efforts to channel expenditure towards capital spending are recommended. While contingent liabilities stemming from SOE-led infrastructure projects remain contained, monitoring is warranted. Lastly, energy subsidy reforms should be continued so that more fiscal resources can be channeled to finance needed infrastructure projects, while targeted assistance could be provided to vulnerable groups during the transitional period.",FALSE,normal
19,7,"28. To reduce Indonesia’s susceptibility to external shocks in the long term, the authorities should make greater efforts to develop and deepen the domestic financial markets and broaden the institutional investor base. In addition to the development of new structured instruments, such as securitization of infrastructure loans, efforts to promote greater use of money market reference rates will support a more liquid and deeper capital market. These include the provision of INDONIA - a new overnight benchmark based on actual transactions in July 2018, and an enhanced Jakarta Interbank Offer Rate (JIBOR) for term rates by adopting IOSCO principles for financial benchmarks as a suitable reference rate for interest rate swaps expected by January 2019. The future adoption of the General Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) could bring about the participation of non-bank institutions and increase liquidity in the repo market. From an institutional perspective, the authorities should also take measures to encourage and facilitate the development of domestic institutional investors such as insurance and pension funds. Efforts have been made to strengthen financial literacy and inclusion, including financing initiatives catered to certain communities who have little or no access to bank loans. Last, but not least, the rapid growth of Fintech, albeit from a small base, will also contribute to financial inclusion and market deepening in Indonesia.",FALSE,normal

They agreed with AMRO’s recommendation that continuous recalibration of the policy mix would be essential, in light of increased uncertainty in the global environment going forward. In this regard, the authorities reiterated their commitment towards safeguarding short-term stability and readiness to take further pre-emptive measures should stability risks continue to build up. On the other hand, while priority would continue to be given to short-term stability, the policy mix framework provides the authorities with flexibility to adjust other policy instruments, such as macroprudential measures, to counterbalance the adverse impact on growth without sending conflicting signals to the market.",FALSE,normal
20,7,"31. The authorities elaborated that the concept of “short-term stability” in their policy mix framework, encompass not only price and financial stability but also, and more comprehensively, economic and social stability. In this regard, keeping subsidized fuel prices stable in support of the recovery in consumers’ purchasing power – which declined somewhat in 2017 due to increased electricity tariffs –ahead of elections this year and in 2019, is also an integral part of the policy mix package to maintain short-term stability. Regarding the concern over Pertamina’s financial soundness, the authorities assured that they were mindful of this. One of the options under discussion is for the budget to share part of the costs incurred by Pertamina in keeping subsidized fuel prices unchanged this year. This coupled with Pertamina’s efficiency-enhancing measures and a number of concessions entitled by the authorities, are expected to support Pertamina in maintaining its financial soundness, despite the higher cost incurred from fuel subsidies.",FALSE,normal

As far as structural reforms are concerned, the authorities highlighted recent efforts to continue improving the business climate and attracting investment into export-oriented industries in the economy, in addition to ongoing infrastructure investment drive, while noting that it may take time for the benefit of these reform measures to materialize. The two recent examples highlighted by the authorities were the launch of the Online Single Submission (OSS) platform and revised tax holidays for new (and expanded) investment in a number of upstream industries.

30,6,"1. External spillovers could be transmitted via different channels, depending on the nature of the shock as well as inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the affected economy. Recent episodes of global volatilities, triggered by a combination of factors, including market uncertainty over the pace of Fed rate hike, fueled by strong U.S. economic data, and escalating trade tensions among global powerhouses have led to higher risk aversion sentiments and investors’ rebalancing of their emerging market portfolio, including Indonesia. The current literature finds that international capital flows after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) have shifted from bank loans to direct market financing. Drivers of such shift include a number of push factors, most notably global risk aversion, as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX index)34, and US economic and monetary conditions, as reflected via the strength of the U.S. dollar (the U.S. dollar index – DXY)35. This selected issue focuses on a preliminary analysis of external shocks related to the above-mentioned factors on Indonesia. A simplified scenario exercise is also conducted to test Indonesia’s resilience to such shocks.",FALSE,normal
30,7,"2. Preliminary analysis suggest that bond and equity flows into Indonesia exhibit a negative correlation with global risk aversion. Figures A1.1 and A1.2 plot the monthly change in bond and equity flows (in rupiah terms) into Indonesia against the (log) change in the monthly VIX, indicating that rising global risk version tend to correlate with net capital outflows from both bond and equity markets, with a somewhat stronger correlation for the equity flow. A close look at the movement of capital flows during the GFC in 2008, U.S. debt ceiling crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis (ESDC) in 2011-2012, market anxiety over China spillovers in August-September 2015, as well as Trump’s U.S. election victory – when the VIX index increased sharply, show significant outflows from Indonesia’s bond and equity markets, with larger magnitude for the latter (Figures A1.3 & A1.4)36. In the latest episode of global uncertainty in early 2018, market anxiety over stronger-than expected US economic data and escalating global trade tensions shored up the VIX index, triggering investors’ EM portfolio rebalancing and relatively large capital outflows from Indonesia.37",FALSE,normal

More specifically, the VIX Index is intended to provide an instantaneous measure of how much the market thinks the S&P 500 Index will fluctuate in the 30 days from the time of each tick of the VIX Index. 35 The broad dollar index – DXY is an index of the value of the U.S. dollar in comparison to a basket of six currencies (euro, Japanese yen, Pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc) 36 The only exception is during the taper tantrum period in May 2013 when capital outflows, in particular from the equity market, were significant while the VIX remained relatively stable. 37 Foreign investors redeemed partly their holding of IGBs in the secondary bond market in early 2018, which lowered foreign ownership of IGBs from 41 percent of total bonds outstanding in January 2018 to 38 percent, as at June. Foreign net selling of Indonesian equities, which started from mid-2017, also intensified in the first half of 2018, with net outflows amounting to IDR43.3 trillion in January-June, in tandem with a sharp fall in the Jakarta Composite Index.",FALSE,normal

31,6,"4. A simplified scenario exercise conducted by AMRO staff suggests that Indonesia has become more resilient to capital flow reversal risks, supported by the accumulation of ample foreign reserves in the past years. Simulation results show that in an extreme scenario based on the GFC episode, external spillovers via financial markets could lead to net capital outflows of about 2.6 percentage points of GDP (Tables A1.1 & A1.2). However, even in this scenario, the reserves would remain adequate at about USD102 billion, well above the conventional metrics of 3 months of imports, as well as within the range of 100- 150 percent of ARA metrics recommended by the IMF. This is mainly due to the past efforts in building up the reserves buffer, with the official foreign reserves rising to all-time high of USD130.2 billion as at end-2017.

32,12,"5. Pro-active recalibration of the policy mix is essential in strengthening resilience against external shocks, including further pre-emptive measures to safeguard short- term stability, and structural reforms to enhance medium- to long-term prospects. Amid the latest episode of capital flow reversal in H1 2018, Bank Indonesia increased its policy rates twice by a total of 50 basis points in May 2018, and again in June by another 50 basis points. These “pre-emptive, frontloading and ahead-of-the-curve” policy actions were welcomed by the market. In light of continued uncertainty in the global markets and prevailing capital flow reversal risks, it is encouraging that the authorities are open to additional policy rate hikes. As a number of studies have found, the role of economic fundamentals has become more important in explaining differences in EMs’ responses to post-GFC external shocks 38 . Indonesia’s fiscal and structural reforms in recent years to strengthen its fundamentals were prudent, and further reforms should continue to help differentiate Indonesia from other EMs (Figure A1.7). Ongoing efforts of financial deepening, including the establishment of relevant benchmarks and products to pool in new liquidity and investors, are also commendable. Table A1.2.

33,5,2. Inter-government Fiscal Relationship in Indonesia,FALSE,normal
33,6,"6. Indonesia has embarked on fiscal decentralization since the early 2000s, which has restructured the inter-governmental fiscal relationship. A new intergovernmental fiscal framework has been introduced with the enforcement of Law 22/1999 on local governments’ authority and responsibility and Law 25/1999 on the central government’s transfer and local governments’ own source of revenue from 2001. In particular, earmarked grants have been replaced with general grants (block grants), allowing local governments (LGs) greater flexibility in their budget planning and execution. LGs have been also assigned with more spending responsibilities in tandem with increased transfer from the CG. This selected issue focusses on major developments in LGs’ budget structure and implementation during the decentralization period using budget data from the Ministry of Finance of Indonesia. Recent Developments in Inter-governmental Fiscal Relations",FALSE,normal
33,7,"7. LGs’ expenditure has expanded rapidly, mainly financed by increased transfers from the CG, while their own source of revenue has also picked up. Table A2.1 shows the overall picture of the inter-governmental fiscal relationship during the decentralization period. With the implementation of Law 22/1999 and Law 25/1999 in 2001, LGs’ expenditure has increased sharply and so has the transfers from the CG to LGs. For instance, LGs’ expenditure increased from 15.9 percent of total consolidated expenditure in 2000 to 46.5 percent in 2016. A large number of facilities has been transferred to the LGs (e.g. health and education facilities), while almost two third of the civil servants in the central government (CG) were re-assigned to the LGs. Similarly, transfer from CG to LGs also rose from 14.9 percent of CG expenditure in 2000 to 38.1 percent in 2016. In addition to regional transfers, transfers to so-called “village funds” have been introduced to enhance infrastructure development and local economic activities at villages/subregional levels. Lastly, aggregate revenue data show that LGs’ own source of revenue has increased during the same period, from about 14.6 percent of total LGs’ revenue in 2000 to 22.6 percent in 2016 (Table A2.1).

34,6,"8. Despite a pick-up in their own revenue, LGs remain reliant on CG transfer. Table A2.2 shows LGs’ own source of revenues (OSR) versus CG transfer in 2011 and 2016, focusing on the revenue distribution pattern across LGs39. OSR contribution to LGs’ total revenue increased from 9.7 percent on average in 2011 to 12.2 percent in 2016. The share of CG transfer moderated from 83.7 percent in 2011, but remained significant at 79.8 percent in 2016. In this regard, the CG’s budget performance could affect LGs’ budget execution.

34,8,"9. A relatively large proportion of LGs’ budget is still allocated towards operational spending, amid increased capital spending. Table A2.3 shows that the share of operational spending, mainly personnel spending and material purchases, in LGs’ total expenditure, moderated somewhat from 68.2 percent on average in 2011, but remained significant at 59.4 percent in 2016. On a positive note, LGs’ capital spending picked up from 22.8 percent of total spending in 2011 to 24.8 percent in 2016, possibly due to measures to encourage LGs to allocate a minimum of 25 percent of their budget to capital expenditure. LGs’ Budget Planning and Realization",FALSE,normal
34,9,"10. The number of LGs with realized budget deficits has increased in recent years, likely driven by smaller revenue sharing from CG. Table A2.4 summarizes LGs’ budget plan versus realization in 2011 and 2016. In 2011, about 84 percent of LGs planned some budget deficits, whereas the number of LGs which actually ran deficits is only 18 percent. The picture changed somewhat in 2016, with the number of LGs which ran deficits rising sharply to about 60 percent (compared with about 81 percent planning a deficit in the same year). This could be due to smaller CG revenue realization than planned in 2016 on the back of lower commodity (oil) prices. As LGs still relied significantly on transfers from CG, the revenue shortfall in the CG has led to smaller revenue transfers to LGs (Table A2.5) resulting in more LGs with realized budget deficits than planned in 2016.

35,5,"11. A slow and uneven pace of expenditure disbursement is another challenge related to LGs’ budget execution. Monthly bank deposits held by LGs could be used as mirrored data for LGs’ expenditure disbursement, indicating that disbursement is generally slow in the early part of the year and spiked up only in the final months of the year (Figure A2.1)40. This also matches the pattern of monthly regional transfer from the CG, which tend to be moderate in the beginning and increase sharply towards the year-end. Figure A2.1.

35,9,"12. Most of LGs have built up fiscal reserves, which can be used for financing deficits in years when there is a shortfall in revenue, or injecting capital in SOEs owned by LGs.

The average size of LGs’ SILPA as of 2016 was IDR173 billion, with some LGs reporting a cumulative surplus of up to IDR10.6 trillion.

35,10,"13. LGs’ autonomy in budget execution has increased in tandem with fiscal decentralization efforts in the past years. LGs’ expenditure has expanded significantly, mainly financed by increased transfer from the CG, while their own source of revenue has also picked up. LGs’ still-heavy reliance on CG transfers has partly affected LGs’ budget execution, characterized by uneven disbursement during the year. While capital spending has increased among LGs in recent years, the share of operating spending in LGs’ total expenditure remains significant. Lastly, despite the challenge in budget execution emanating from CG revenue shortfall and smaller revenue transfers from CG, most of the LGs have continued to build up fiscal reserves.",FALSE,normal

36,5,3. SOEs in Indonesia: Recent Developments,FALSE,normal
36,6,"14. State-Owned Enterprises have played an important role in the Indonesian economy, serving as a vehicle to implement the government’s overarching economic development policies. As of 2016, there were about 99 non-financial State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) with total assets worth 26 percent of GDP, concentrated in electricity and gas, mining and quarrying, transport and warehouse, and construction sectors (Figure A3.1). According to OECD’s estimate41, Indonesia is one of the top 10 countries with the highest SOEs’ share among their largest firms. This box discusses the recent developments in non- financial SOEs, specifically energy and infrastructure-related SOEs, in the context of the energy subsidy reform and infrastructure-push strategy in the past years. Figure A3.1. Non-financial SOEs’ Total Assets Figure A3.2. Non-financial SOEs’ Total Liabilities Note: The increase in assets in 2015 and 2016 was driven largely by PLN’s asset revaluation in 2016, applied retroactively to 2015. Sources: National Authorities, AMRO staff calculations Note: The decline in liabilities in 2016 was driven by a sharp fall in long- term lease of the electricity SOE PLN, due to the change in accounting practice.

36,9,"15. Data suggest that SOEs’ financial positions remained sound with contained debt level, adequate liquidity, and sustained profitability. SOEs’ liabilities were contained at below 12 percent of GDP (Figure A3.2), of which loan liabilities remained manageable at around 5 percent of GDP (Table A3.1). SOEs maintained sufficient liquidity to meet their short- term obligations, as indicated in their current ratio and interest coverage ratio. Lastly, SOEs’ net profit margins have also picked up from some deterioration in 2013-2014 (Table A3.2). Table A3.2. Selected Key Ratios of Non-financial SOEs Key ratios (%) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015* 2016 Current ratio 1.35 1.39 1.30 1.29 1.28 1.33 Net profit margin 0.06 0.06 0.04 0.04 0.53 0.11 Debt to Equity Ratio 1.52 1.61 1.65 1.74 0.94 0.81 Interest coverage ratio 5.85 4.64 3.09 3.33 2.43 4.15 Note: */ The jump in net profit margin in 2015 was driven by the change in methodology of asset valuation for PLN in 2016 and applied retroactively to 2015. Based on PLN’s financial statement 2016, the asset revaluation worth IDR653 trillion was categorized as “property, plant and equipment revaluation surplus” under “other comprehensive income for the year” in 2015. The decrease in interest coverage ratio in 2015 was partly due to the PLN’s forex losses, leading to lower earnings before interest and tax.

37,5,"largest oil and gas company, Pertamina, witnessed an improvement in their gross profits (prior to government subsidies), due to lower production (oil) costs and adjustments in the pricing mechanism of retail products in alignment with world markets prices (Table A3.3a)42. Other financial ratios, such as debt-to-equity ratios, also pointed to a better performance, especially for Pertamina. While gross profits improved, PLN’s current ratio has declined below 1 since 2013, possibly reflecting weakness in managing liquidity and ability to pay interest expenses (Table A3.3b). Table A3.3. Financial Performance of Energy SOEs a. Income Statement, Selected Components, % of GDP b.

37,6,"17. Liabilities in construction, and transport and warehouse SOEs have risen, in tandem with their increased involvement in the recent infrastructure investment drive. As mentioned in Box A, SOEs have become the second largest funding source for infrastructure projects. This has led to an increase in liabilities of related SOEs from below 1 percent of GDP prior to 2013 to 2.5 percent in 2016, driving their debt to equity ratios higher. Besides traditional access to bank loans, new financing tools such as securitization and global IDR-linked bond issuance have been increasingly explored. Financial data, meanwhile, suggest related SOEs remain healthy, given their ability to maintain profits and liquidity (Table A3.4). Table A3.4.
