4,4,Executive Summary,FALSE,normal
4,5,"1. Korea’s economy is expected to grow at potential. The economy expanded by 2.8 percent in H1 2018, mainly on the back of strong exports, expansionary fiscal spending and continued improvement in private consumption. Meanwhile, private investment slowed down in this period. In the labor market, the employment growth weakened due to corporate restructuring, a declining working-age population, more use of automation and e-commerce, and to a certain extent, higher minimum wages. The economy is expected to grow at 2.7 percent in 2018 and 2.6 percent in 2019.",FALSE,normal
4,6,"2. Headline inflation eased from 1.9 percent in 2017 to 1.4 percent in H1 2018, remaining below the BOK’s 2 percent target, as fresh food, agricultural and public service prices stabilized. Demand-side pressure was dampened by the slowing economy. Inflation expectations hover at around 2.5 percent. Headline inflation is expected to moderate to 1.6 percent in 2018 and rise to 1.9 percent in 2019, driven mainly by supply-side factors.",FALSE,normal
4,7,"3. The economy is resilient to external shocks on the back of sustained current account surpluses and ample international reserves. The current account surplus will remain unchanged, as buoyant ICT and petrochemical exports and rising revenue from Chinese tourists would be offset by growing Korean overseas tourism and strong intermediate imports. The current account surplus is invested abroad in the form of overseas direct investment and rising outward portfolio investment. Despite heightened external uncertainty, Korean financial markets witnessed capital inflows, particularly into its bond markets, and was less volatile than other emerging market economies (EMEs) amid easing geopolitical tension and a strong external position.",FALSE,normal
4,8,"4. The monetary policy stance remains accommodative with the real base rate at around zero percent. Corporate financing inched up owing to a pick-up in bank loans and bond issuance, while household debt growth has moderated, reflecting the effects of tighter macro-prudential measures. Financial institutions are sound, as reflected in the strong financial soundness indicators. Despite a high level of household debt and ongoing corporate restructuring, credit risk to financial institutions remains contained.",FALSE,normal
4,9,"5. In 2018, fiscal policy has been expansionary in support of the economy. The supplementary budget of KRW3.8 trillion and the fiscal stimulus package of KRW4 trillion were announced in addition to the expenditure increase under the 2018 budget. Due to the considerable expansion of total expenditure amid rising revenue collection, the overall fiscal deficit is expected to widen to -1.8 percent of GDP in 2018.",FALSE,normal
4,10,"6. Weaker-than-expected growth in China and the advanced economies, and an escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict pose downside risks to Korea as Korea’s exports to these countries account for more than half of total exports. The amendment of NAFTA and imposition of U.S. import tariffs on automobile products pose risks to Korea’s automobile industry. In addition, an earlier-than-expected downturn of the global semiconductor super-cycle poses additional downside risks to Korea’s exports and growth.",FALSE,normal

5,4,"risk from the debt build-up is not a concern, given that the debt is concentrated in mid- to high-income borrowers. However, low-income borrowers remain vulnerable and may pose a risk to financial institutions in the event of a sharp rise in interest rate and deterioration in the labor market. In the property sector, the housing prices in Seoul had risen rapidly until the government announced additional policy measures to stabilize the housing market in September 2018.",FALSE,normal
5,5,"8. Although the external sector remains very strong, Korea’s financial markets are deep and highly open, which makes the markets sensitive to volatility in the global markets and cross-border capital flows. A faster-than-expected pace of monetary policy normalization in the U.S. and other advanced economies as well as renewed geopolitical tension in the region, could heighten volatility in Korea’s financial markets.",FALSE,normal
5,6,"9. Over the medium- to long-term, Korea’s potential growth will face challenges in the labor market and industry. The labor market continues to face structural challenges stemming from an aging population and youth underemployment. Declining competitiveness in the non-ICT industries and overseas outsourcing in key manufacturing sectors will weaken domestic employment and investment further. Moreover, excessive concentration in ICT industries may result in the Korean economy being susceptible to shocks arising from global ICT downturns.",FALSE,normal
5,7,"10. The government’s efforts to shift towards a new growth paradigm could well address structural issues in the economy; however, all four pillars of the strategy should be implemented in a well-coordinated manner. Income policy should be well-executed to avoid creating adverse consequences in the labor market and should be complemented by growth-oriented policies and expanding social safety nets. Ongoing efforts to promote innovation and fair competition are welcome and should be expedited, while structural reforms in the service sectors and non-ICT manufacturing industries should be stepped up to enhance productivity and competitiveness as well as to create more quality jobs.",FALSE,normal
5,8,"11. Given ample fiscal space, the active use of fiscal policy to pursue more inclusive economic growth and promote innovation-led growth while maintaining long-term fiscal sustainability is commendable. Assigning more budget allocation to the income policy and social welfare is welcome. However, fiscal spending should be allocated more towards the sustainable growth objective such as moving the services sector up the value chain.",FALSE,normal
5,9,"12. The accommodative monetary policy stance should be maintained in view of moderating economic growth and subdued inflation. The positive output gap has narrowed recently with the moderating economy. The Korean economy also faces challenges from a weak labor market and downside risks from the escalation of global trade tensions. Meanwhile, headline inflation is expected to be lower than the BOK’s target due to soft demand pressure.",FALSE,normal
5,10,"13. A series of tighter regulations has largely contained the build-up of household debt and housing prices, although pockets of risk remain and warrant close monitoring. The full implementation of the Debt Service Ratio (DSR) is expected to safeguard financial stability. The mission commends the government’s continuing and timely efforts to stabilize the housing market. In addition, close monitoring of housing prices needs to be carried out, especially in Seoul metropolitan area.",FALSE,normal

6,5,"1. The Korean economy registered growth of around 2.8 percent in H1 2018. The growth was underpinned by strong exports, expansionary fiscal spending and continued improvement in private consumption (Figure 1). Private consumption continued to grow, supported by rising household income and the Winter Olympics. Private investment, on the other hand, slowed down due to a high base in facilities investment and continued correction in construction activities. A series of property-related taxes and macro-prudential measures on mortgage loans curbed residential property construction. Merchandise exports continued to expand, albeit moderating from a high base in 2017, on the back ICT exports. Meanwhile, there was a slowdown in merchandise import growth, particularly capital goods imports, due to subdued domestic investment. On the production side, the services sector continued to expand, while construction was subdued due to measures imposed on the property sector. Overall, the manufacturing sector moderated slightly in 2018.",FALSE,normal
6,6,"2. Going forward, Korea’s economic growth is likely to stay at around potential, although it will moderate somewhat. The economy is expected to grow at 2.7 percent in 2018 and 2.6 percent in 2019, led by exports and private consumption. Korea’s merchandise export will post a positive growth due to the continuing expansion in the global ICT industry. Private consumption will continue to grow thanks to the government’s stimulus measures and rising income. Expansionary fiscal policies including previous fiscal measures to subsidize households’ living expenses will support the growth. However, growth is expected to moderate further in 2019, weighed down by high household debt and headwinds from the escalation of global trade tensions. Meanwhile, investment is expected to be subdued reflecting corrections in facilities investment and measures imposed on the property market, although large corporates have announced new facilities investment plans.",FALSE,normal

Under the income-led growth strategy, the minimum wage was raised by 16.4 percent at the beginning of 2018 and scheduled to increase by another 10.9 percent in 2019. Moreover, work hours were reduced in large firms starting in July 2018.

By status, temporary and daily workers underpin the decline in employment, while regular employment has held up well. Meanwhile, the youth unemployment rate remains high, despite various government support measures and incentives for youth employment. In addition to corporate restructuring, the decline in employment is also on account of a declining working-age population, greater use of automation, and the increases in the minimum wage.

Consumer price inflation eased from 1.9 percent in 2017 to 1.4 percent in H1 2018 as fresh food, agriculture and public service prices stabilized (Figure 4). Demand-side pressure was dampened by a narrowing positive output gap, as indicated by weaker consumer confidence and lower core inflation. Inflation expectations have been hovering at around 2.5 percent since early 2016. Going forward, headline inflation is expected to moderate to 1.6 percent in 2018 before rising to 1.9 percent in 2019, driven by supply-side factors including the planned increase in public utility prices as well as the lagged effect of higher oil prices. Demand-side pressure will continue to be soft, even though the reduction in individual consumption taxes for oil and newly purchased vehicles will boost spending.",FALSE,normal

7,9,"5. In the authorities’ view, Korea’s economic growth will continue at a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, considering current economic conditions. The authorities expected the Korean economy to be faced with upside risks in 2018 from the buoyancy of the global economy, the facilities investment of large companies, and a more expansionary fiscal stance. Growth is projected at 2.7 percent in 2018 and 2019.

8,5,"6. The trade surplus remained strong in H1 2018 but the U.S. trade measures imposed earlier this year have adversely impacted some industries. Exports excluding vessels continued to grow, albeit slowing, underpinned by the strong growth of semiconductors and petrochemical exports, while the imports growth moderated due to a high- base effect and slow domestic investment (Figure 5). Vessel exports were on the recovery trajectory with new shipbuilding orders inching up since 2017 (See Selected Issue 2: Update on The Corporate Restructuring of Korea’s Shipbuilding Industry). Meanwhile, automotive exports have dropped since early 2018, mainly led by exports to the U.S. market, due to corporate restructuring in the auto industry. 2 The amended Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement3 signed on 24 September 2018 is expected to have limited impact on Korea’s auto industry as American car imports to Korea remained lower than the quota. Moreover, the extension of U.S. tariffs on Korean truck imports is unlikely to affect Korean automakers, since the companies had already planned to produce trucks in its U.S.-based factories. In terms of the impact of U.S. trade measures, according to the Korea International Trade Association4, Korean steel exports to the U.S.5 have declined since March 2018. Moreover, U.S measures led to a drop in Korea’s washing machine exports to the U.S. by 50 percent and solar panels by 16.6 percent between January and May 2018. The U.S. quota on Korean steel6 imports and subsequent exemption to specific exporters signals uncertainty for Korea’s steel industry.",FALSE,normal
8,6,"7. The current account surplus is expected to be sustained, albeit registering a slight decline in 2019. In addition to buoyant ICT and petrochemical exports, a rebound in Chinese tourist arrivals is expected to continue and help in reducing the service account deficit, reflecting an easing in political tension between China and Korea over the installation of the U.S. made anti-missile system (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense – THAAD). However, strong revenue from exports of goods and services will be offset by the rapidly growing Korean overseas tourism and strong imports of the ICT industry (Figure 6). Going forward, the current account surplus is expected to be at 5.3 percent of GDP in 2018, reducing slightly to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2019.",FALSE,normal
8,7,"2 In addition to the corporate restructuring, the Korean auto industry also face structural challenges stemming from lower competitiveness of Korean auto brands in the U.S. market and higher labor costs compared to its Japanese and German competitors. Moreover, Korean car makers have transferred some of production from their Korean-based factories to Mexico- and U.S.-based factories gradually since 2013, while they have reduced production and export volume in Korea. 3 The phasing out of the 25.0 percent U.S. tariffs on Korean truck imports was extended from 2021 to 2041. Moreover, the quota of the U.S. auto exports to Korea was increased from 25,000 to 50,000 cars per manufacturer with adoption of U.S. safety standards. 4 Korea International Trade Association (KITA).

9,6,"8. Despite heightened external uncertainty, financial markets in Korea have been relatively less volatile than other EMEs, amid the easing of geopolitical tension. In 2018, Korea’s financial markets experienced a sharp but temporary rise in volatility stemming from concerns of a faster pace of Federal rate hikes and an escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict. Despite wider negative yield spreads between the Korean and the U.S. Treasury bonds, and increased risk aversion towards EMEs, Korea’s bond market has continued to see inflows, supported by strong macroeconomic fundamentals and a sound external position (Figure 7). Recently, the Korean won has depreciated against the U.S. dollar, along with most regional currencies, following the U.S. announcement of increased tariffs on Chinese imports in June.",FALSE,normal
9,7,"9. Korea has continued to build up its net creditor position (Figure 8), and the economy has become resilient to external shocks on the back of ample international reserves. The bulk of the current account surplus is invested overseas in the form of overseas direct and portfolio investment by Korean residents. Korean corporates have been outsourcing their production to seek lower labor cost and to gain market share (See Box A. Development of Korea’s Overseas Direct Investment), whereas rising overseas portfolio investments have been driven mainly by pension funds and other institutional investors, in search of higher yields and diversification of their investment assets. The overall balance is expected to register a surplus and international reserves to increase to about USD 400 billion by the end of 2018, equivalent to 6.6 months of goods and services imports. Gross external debt amounted to around 28.1 percent of GDP or 26.6 percent of international reserves at end of Q2 2018 with short-term debt at around one-third of the total.",FALSE,normal

10,5,"Korea’s ODI started to grow faster in the 1990s after ODI-related regulations were relaxed. According to Kim and Rhee (2009), Korea’s ODI was originally regulated by the foreign investment law under the foreign exchange regulations. However, the government gradually liberalized ODI regulations in the 1980s and ODI started to speed up in the 1990s (Figure A1). Kim and Rhee (2009) argued that market expansion and the acquisition of strategic assets – including technologies – were key motivations for Korean ODI, particularly in advanced economies. On the other hand, cost reduction by leveraging on low wages and market expansion were the drivers for ODI to developing economies. In addition, the government continues to take measures – such as financial support, taxation and overseas investment information services – to support ODI. As financial support, the Export- Import Bank of Korea provides loans to support overseas investment. The Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-SURE), meanwhile, provides overseas investment insurance, covering the risks of expropriation, war, failure to execute agreements, money transfer, force majeure and the like. Tax support includes avoidance of double taxation according to bilateral governmental taxation agreements. The Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, which has 126 offices in the world, supports overseas investments by providing market information on foreign countries.",FALSE,normal
10,6,"Developments of Korean ODI from 1980 can be separated into four sub-periods based on differences in destination and targeted sectors (Figures A2 and A3). In the first period (1980-1989) in which ODI from Korea was relatively restricted, the main destination was North America accounting for 40 percent of total ODI flows at that time, followed by Asia. Targeted sectors were mining, manufacturing and finance. In the second period (1990-2006), Korean investors’ interests in developing economies increased, reflected by a rising share of ODI flows to Asia and Latin America. Notwithstanding the greater attractiveness of developing economies, the share of Korean ODI flows into developed countries in North America and Europe remained high, accounting for around 40 percent of total ODI flows in that period. By sector, Korean ODI flows among manufacturing firms rose remarkably, accounting for 52.7 percent of total ODI flows in that period. During the third period (2007- 2015), ODI outflows expanded considerably and reached about 2 percent of GDP, partly contributed by rising current account surplus. China and Vietnam are top destinations of ODI from Korea since 2007. Additionally, the structure of Korean ODI witnessed an increased share of ODI to Eastern Europe and the Middle East as well. By sector, Korean ODI to the financial sector as well as mining expanded. In the last period (2016-2017), Korean ODI grew at a relatively faster pace than the past. The recent surge in ODI was driven by ODI to the U.S. and, by sector, ODI to the financial sector (especially in Southeast Asian countries), wholesale and retail sales as well as manufacturing (Figure A3). The expanding share of finance and insurance sector was driven by growing demand from Korean firms that expand their overseas business and Korean financial institutions’ increasing interests in foreign markets. In 2017, there was a mega M&A deal worth USD8 billion in the U.S.,8 classified as part of the wholesale & retail sales category. The number of Korean firms involved in M&A in the U.S. is also increasing in order to improve R&D activities and to acquire new technologies. Meanwhile, Korean manufacturers also have strong motivation to invest in developing markets - such as Peru, Chile and Brazil - to expand local market share and to benefit from cheap labor.",FALSE,normal

The Korean economy is susceptible to a slowdown of the Chinese economy and weaker-than-expected growth in the advanced economies as Korea’s exports to these countries account for more than half of total exports. Since Korea’s exports to China and the U.S. are mostly for domestic demand, the intensification of the U.S.-China trade conflict could have limited direct impact on Korea’s exports in the early stage of the tariff enforcement. However, the indirect impact stemming from a slowdown in the Chinese and the U.S. economies would dampen Korea’s economic growth. The amendment of NAFTA and the imposition of U.S. import tariffs on automobile products pose risks to Korea’s automobile industry. (Box B: Potential Impacts from the Ongoing Global Trade Tensions). Separately, disruption in global trade activities could also affect the Korean shipbuilding industry, which accounted for around 7 percent of total exports in 2017.

The risks became imminent following the U.S.’ decision to impose global tariffs on washing machines and solar panels in January 2018, followed by global tariffs on steel and aluminum in March. Thereafter, the U.S. trade protectionism has intensified. The U.S. administration has announced a series of tariffs on imports from China. In response, the Chinese government has taken retaliatory action on imports from the U.S. Korea, as a highly-open economy, is inevitably affected by this trade war as Korea’s exports to these two global economies accounted for 36.7 percent of total trade, equivalent to 13.8 percent of GDP in 2017. In addition to global tariffs and the trade conflicts between its key trading partners, Korea also faced direct pressure from the U.S. through its bilateral trade deal. The U.S. administration pushed Korea to renegotiate the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) in August 2017 with the aim of reducing the U.S. trade deficit against Korea11. The negotiation ended in mid-2018, and the agreement was signed in September 2018.

14,5,"Despite the U.S.’ global tariffs coming into effect, Korea’s total exports still expanded, but adverse impacts were observed at a sectoral level. Despite the U.S. trade measures coming into effect, Korea’s exports to the U.S. posted 2.3 percent growth in the first eight months of 2018 owing to burgeoning semiconductor and petrochemical exports. Meanwhile, Korea’s exports of affected products dropped. According to the Korea International Trade Association, Korean steel exports to the U.S. have declined after the global tariff on steel was implemented. Moreover, U.S. safeguard measures led to a drop in Korea’s exports of washing machines to the U.S. by 50.0 percent and solar panels by 16.6 percent during January and May 2018. Although the U.S. allowed the 70 percent import quota of Korean steel which would be waived from the global tariffs under Section 232, in exchange for improved market access to Korea’s auto market, Korea’s steel exports to the U.S. market is still faced with uncertainty as the exemption was subject to several conditions.

The market share of American cars in Korea was only 2.8 percent in 2017. On the export side, the extension of U.S. tariffs is unlikely to affect Korean automakers, since the companies were already planning to produce trucks at its U.S.-based factories.

While the build-up of household debt has moderated, the household debt-to-disposable income ratio is still high at about 160 percent in Q1 2018. Systemic risk from the debt build-up is not a concern yet, given that the debt distribution is skewed towards mid- to high-income borrowers with large holdings of financial assets and low default rates. However, low-income and self-employed borrowers remain vulnerable to financial distress due to low income and low financial assets relative to debt (Figure 14).15 These borrowers may pose a risk to the asset quality of financial institutions16 in the event of rising interest rate and worsening labor market conditions. In the real estate sector, although housing price growth is moderating across the country, the growth rate in Seoul remains higher than its historical record and is driven partly by expectations of higher prices.

Behind this successful story, the economy relied heavily on large conglomerates in a few manufacturing sectors such as ICT, automotive, shipbuilding as the main drivers of growth. However, potential growth has declined owing to structural challenges stemming from an aging population and labor market rigidity.

The NEP addresses intensifying economic polarization, declining potential growth and inadequate social protection. The first two pillars of the NEP attempt to increase household income and to improve living standards and working conditions. The third pillar seeks to revitalize private investment and prepare for the fourth industrial revolution, and the last pillar attempts to create a more level playing field between large conglomerates and SMEs.

Moreover, a more expansionary fiscal stance was taken in the 2019 budget. Although the current administration has increased spending, the fiscal balance has not deteriorated sharply due to strong revenue collection (Figure 18).

In 2018, the supplementary budget of KRW3.9 trillion and the additional fiscal stimulus at KRW4 trillion were adopted with the aim of maintaining economic growth momentum and supporting the labor market and restructured corporations.

However, pockets of risk remain. The high household debt-to-disposable income ratio makes the low-income households more susceptible to economic and financial shocks and deteriorating labor market conditions.

23,5,"30. The authorities are paying close attention to financial stability amid the low interest rate environment. A rapid increase in housing prices in Seoul called for tightened measures. Despite a series of measures to stabilize the housing market, housing prices in some areas in Seoul continue to surge, partly contributed by speculative demand. Additional measures announced on 13 September 2018 are expected to curb speculation and stabilize housing prices in areas with overheating. Given the high household debt, the full implementation of the DSR framework is expected to lead to a further moderation in household debt. The authorities provide specific assistance targeted to vulnerable and low-income households.",FALSE,normal

23,7,"In the period of easing monetary policy since 2014, Korea has experienced a rapid increase in household debt and housing prices. In addition, the relaxation of loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio in August 2014 to support the housing market also spurred the growth of household debt in the following period. The annual growth of household debt rose from 5.7 percent in 2013 to its peak of 11.6 percent in 2016. In terms of household indebtedness, the household debt- to-disposable income ratio increased from around 134 percent in 2013 to 160 percent in 2017. Meanwhile, the housing market had boomed in almost the same period. The growth rate of nationwide housing prices doubled in one year, from 1.5 percent in 2014 to 3.4 percent in 2015. From mid-2015, nationwide housing prices have moderated, but the housing prices in some big cities continue to surge. Reflecting historical co-movements, and the results of the causality test, the increase in household debt and housing prices are inter-connected to some extent. According to Table 5.1, household debt increase has a lead effect to housing price growth. This may imply that a rapid rise in mortgage lending might spur housing demand.",FALSE,normal
23,8,"While monetary accommodation has been maintained to support growth in a low inflation environment, the Korean authorities have deployed a series of pre-emptive policy actions to contain the build-up of financial stability risks (Appendix 5). Policymakers have used a broad range of policy instruments (“measures” hereafter) including macro-prudential regulations, property- related taxes and land development policies to manage demand and supply of loans and residential property. Despite the relaxation of the LTV and DTI ratios in 2014, prudential regulations related to household borrowing were strengthened in 2015. Over time, as household debt and housing market situations changed, the choices of instruments have been broadened and the measures have been more targeted and recalibrated to address different problems. The differentiation in measures reflects geographical heterogeneity of housing demand and supply, diverse financing and housing needs across households, and the unique characteristics of each group of financial institutions.",FALSE,normal

24,4,"In 2014-2015, the measures focused on improving the structure of household loans of banks and non-banks, and on ensuring households’ financial soundness. Financial institutions and borrowers were encouraged to shift from floating-rate and balloon-payment mortgages to fixed-rate and amortizing mortgages. Banks’ screening process of mortgage loan applications was also revised to more accurately assess borrower’s repayment ability. The loan structure of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) was improved by imposing the LTV ratio on mortgages and increasing the share of amortizing mortgages. The effectiveness of the measures was limited, as reflected by the continuing rise in housing prices and household debt.",FALSE,normal
24,5,"Given the many types of financial institutions, Korea’s macro-prudential measures faced implementation challenges in the form of regulatory arbitrage. Due to some exemptions allowed for collective loans, burgeoning collective loans was one of the driving factors of a household debt surge in 2014-2015. In 2016, given the relatively tight regulations on bank lending to households, NBFI lending to households has outpaced bank lending since 2016. This led the authorities to tighten measures on collective loans and NBFIs. Moreover, risk management and monitoring of loans for self-employed business owners, part of which are counted in household debt, are strengthened in order to ensure that the loans would not be used for personal consumption or housing purchase.",FALSE,normal
24,6,"From 2016 onwards, the measures were aimed at suppressing speculative housing demand and curbing the build-up in household debt. Amid tightened measures on mortgage lending, housing prices in major cities and non-metropolitan areas began to diverge in late 2015. The pace of the housing price increase was even faster in some districts, driven partly by expectations of higher prices. At the same time, the growth of household debt continued to increase. The authorities imposed measures that specifically targeted overheating areas that witnessed speculative housing demand and high levels of household debt. The LTV ratio and the DTI ratio were reduced twice in 2017. The tighter ceilings were imposed on designated overheating areas and multiple-mortgage borrowers. The formula of the DTI ratio was also broadened to cover more comprehensive household debt obligations. Moreover, the DSR was introduced as an additional indicator for assessing borrowers’ debt repayment capacity. Following a series of tightened macro-prudential regulations, the growth of household debt began to moderate in early 2017, although it still remained high, while housing prices in some parts of major cities still surged and actually grew much more rapidly than the long-term trend. In response, an increase in property-related taxes, targeted at speculative zones and multiple-mortgage borrowers, as well as supply-side measures such as reconstruction regulations and an increase in the government’s housing supply, have been deployed.",FALSE,normal

35,4,Annexes: Selected Issues 1. Assessment of Weakening Employment Conditions,FALSE,normal
35,5,"1. Employment growth has been largely lagging GDP growth, despite showing some signs of decoupling with GDP growth, which has been hovering around its potential level. In theory, in response to labor markets shocks, employers tend to adjust working hours first and then employment subsequently. Following the global financial crisis (GFC), Korea witnessed changes in total employment, or job growth, largely in line with the theory that employment tends to lag business cycles. However, it appears that since early 2018, employment has deteriorated gradually, even though real GDP growth has remained moderate – 3.1 percent in 2017 and 2.8 percent in H1 2018 – at around the potential growth rate (FigureA1.1). This Selected Issue attempts to explore the background of employment deterioration in early 2018 from looking at the various relevant data as well as conducting a simple shift-share analysis over its long-term trend.",FALSE,normal

35,7,"2. In H1 2018, employment conditions unexpectedly deteriorated. During the first eight months of 2018, the annual change in total employment, considered as a main indicator to gauge employment conditions, showed a sharp slowdown, which is far below the consensus. The unemployment rate increase to around 4.0 percent, particularly among the youth, where it reached about 10.1 percent (Figure A1.2). The employment-to-population ratio edged down to 60.9 percent in August 2018 from 61.2 percent a year ago, based on the working age population of age 15 and over (the national definition).",FALSE,normal

35,11,"3. By industry segment, employment in the manufacturing sector contracted in H1, while the services sector showed a sharp drop. As per the long-term trend, the increase in total employment over a year ago remained stable at around 300,000 in 2015-2017 after reaching a peak of 902,000 in February 2014. From early 2018, however, total employment growth showed a sharp drop, mainly led by a downward trend in the services sector, shrinkage in the manufacturing sector, and continued weakening in the construction sector (Figure A1.3).",FALSE,normal

For temporary workers (with contracts between one month and one year) job creation declined, albeit less severely on average than in 2017. In contrast, job creation for daily workers (with less than one month’s contract) showed a sharp drop. Among the non-wage worker group, the self- employed showed a slight decline, while its contribution to total employment remains modest compared to that of daily workers (Figure A1.4).",FALSE,normal

36,7,Impact of minimum wage hike,FALSE,normal
36,8,"5. The service sector might have deteriorated further due to the sharp minimum wage hike while its impact on the self-employed group is hard to assess. As the hourly minimum wage was increased by a significant 16.4 percent starting January this year, it is suspected that an abrupt deterioration in employment may be associated with the sharp minimum wage hike. The detailed breakdown of employment data provides mixed evidence on such a conjecture (Figure A1.5). The sharp drop in the service sector’s employment was mainly driven by job losses in the categories of business, personal and public services. Moreover, wholesale and retail job growth turned negative in 2018 while it has shown cyclical fluctuations since mid-2013. The hospitality sector continued its downward trend following last year. In sum, the minimum wage hike may have contributed to accelerating the downward trend in the service sector’s employment growth that had already started even before the hike. However, the more granular employment data for the self-employed business with employees– which is considered as the most vulnerable group to a sharp minimum wage hike23 – seems to contradict the conjecture about adverse impacts of minimum wage hikes on the self-employed business with employees (Figure A1.6). Job creation for the self-employed with employees continued to increase despite the wage hike while the self-employed without employees showed job shedding. Therefore, it is ambiguous to assess the net impact from the minimum wage hike.",FALSE,normal
36,9,"23 In Korea, according to the Statistics Korea survey in 2015, about 50 percent of self-employed business operates has annual sales of less than 46 million won. In particular, the self-employed with employees are active in wholesales and retails (27.7 percent of total units) and accommodation and restaurant (18.8 percent) whose employees are subject to minimum wages. Moreover, 69 percent of them remain small business with hiring 3 employees or less.",FALSE,normal

37,8,"6. The manufacturing sector’s employment was hit hard by the ongoing corporate restructuring in the shipbuilding and auto industries. The shipbuilding industry is showing a modest recovery in new orders after a major shipbuilder being rescued by debt restructurings from its financial distress which peaked in April 2017. Nevertheless, massive layoffs are still underway among shipbuilders as shown in the employment insurance statistics of workers by sub-sectors in manufacturing (Figure A1.7). Moreover, since early 2018, restructuring in the auto industry, combined with weaker production and sales across the board, has led to a sharp drop in employment.",FALSE,normal
37,9,"7. More structurally, a higher reliance on capital-intensive manufacturing - such as the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector - contributes to a reduction in firms’ labor demand. In terms of real GDP, the electric and electronic sector accounted for 10.2 percent in 2017, almost tripling from 3.8 percent in 2000. In contrast, the transportation sector - including automobiles and shipbuilding – increased to 4.2 percent in 2017 from 3.7 percent in 2000. According to Input-Output Statistics, given the demand for final goods, the services sector tends to have the largest job creation capacity, followed by construction and manufacturing (Figure A1.8). Among the manufacturers, the semiconductor industry created only three jobs to meet the final demand of KRW1billion, while non-ICT industries such as autos and shipbuilding created more than six jobs. Hence, Korea’s industrial restructuring towards capital-intensive and automated manufacturing is likely to exert downward pressure on firms’ labor market demands.",FALSE,normal

38,5,"8. Korea’s rapidly aging population, reflecting its low fertility rates, is leading to a shrinkage in labor supply. The working age population (OECD standard, age 15-64) began to shrink after reaching a peak in 2016 (Figure A1.9). By age composition, prime-age workers (age 25-54) show a gradual decline (Figure A1.10). Although ‘baby boomers’ (born in 1955-63) still remain in the labor force, their exits will eventually lead to a decline in labor supply, suggesting that the total employment may decline in the future.",FALSE,normal

38,10,"9. Aging demographic structures may have somewhat offset the boost in the employment-to-population ratio in recent years. Despite some moderation in 2018, from a long-term perspective, Korea’s labor force participation ratio has gradually increased mainly because of the increase in female participation rate and the reentry of older women into the labor force, while remaining lower at 69.2 percent (in 2017) as compared to the OECD average (72.1 percent). A rising trend in labor force participation has positively affected the employment- to-population ratios - another key labor market indicator that is independent of the non-labor force’s size. By age group, the employment-to-population ratio (the national definition) for prime- age workers (age 25-54), is the highest amongst all age groups at about 76.3 percent (as of 2017), while the ratio tends to decline with age - 67.5 percent for ages 55-64, and 30.6 percent for ages 65 and over (Figure A1.11). In essence, an aging population will lead to a dampening employment-to-population ratio via a reduction in the labor force participation ratio.",FALSE,normal
38,11,"10. A decomposition of the employment-to-population ratio suggests that the aging population has already started to have an adverse effect on employment, slowly but persistently.

39,4,"effects of changes in an age-group composition. Our analysis suggests that since the GFC, employment within each-age group continued to make a positive contribution to the total employment-to-population ratio, whereas the contribution of structural change in the population, measured by the shifts in age-group shares, turned negative persistently, albeit with some fluctuations across years, including 201825 (Figure A1.12). The latter can be explained by the fact that the declining share of the prime-age group with the highest employment-to-population ratio adversely affects the aggregate level of the employment-to-population ratio. The results suggest that the decline in the employment-to population ratio during the first eight months is partly affected by demographic changes, although the main driver is a deterioration in employment within age groups.",FALSE,normal

39,10,"11. Moving forward, it appears that a slower increase in employment is inevitable in comparison to the past due to a combination of cyclical and structural factors. As discussed so far, disaggregated employment data as well as adverse implications from the ongoing industrial restructuring and an aging population, support the view that such an unexpected decline in job growth in H1 2018 may emerge from not only the sharp minimum wage hike, but also sectoral adjustments and demographic changes. In this context, weaker employment growth is expected to continue for a prolonged period. On the policy front, more comprehensive and concerted efforts must be made to create job opportunities in “new” innovative industries and start-ups to compensate for declining labor demand in manufacturing. In addition, excessive protection for regular workers must be relaxed along with heightened labor market flexibility to secure more quality jobs for discouraged, young workers.",FALSE,normal

40,5,"1. The shipbuilding industry, a golden industry in Korea previously, has been restructuring from huge losses suffered mainly due to low demand globally and low oil prices during 2014-2016. Korea’s shipbuilding industry has played an important role in the Korean economy. In terms of its contribution to the economy, its shares to GDP and export peaked at 4.7 percent and 11.7 percent in 2009, before declining to 2.8 percent and 7.1 percent in 2017, respectively (Figure A2.1). Workforce in the industry totaled around 120,000 (accounting for 0.5 percent of total workforce) in 2008 and 130,800 in 2017 (0.5 percent) (Figure A2.2). In the midst of slowing global demand, rising competition from regional peers, notably China, and low oil prices from 2014 to 2016, the industry experienced a huge loss, and has been forced to undertake corporate restructuring.

40,7,"2. Korea is among three shipbuilding giants in the world, together with China and Japan. The shipbuilding industry started to develop from early 1970s in Korea. Despite a slowdown in the mid-1980s and during the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC), Korean shipyards received high operating profits on account of the Korean won’s depreciation after the AFC. This provided an additional competitive advantage to the industry. In 2001, Korea overtook Japan in global market share, becoming the largest shipbuilder in the world26, with the order books27 peaking at 64.3 million compensated gross tonnage (CGT)28 and a global market share of 33.1 percent in 2008 (Figure A2.1).",FALSE,normal

In 2015, due to low oil prices, the offshore new building market31 and low trade volume, orders were postponed or cancelled. Together with overcapacity, Korea’s top three shipbuilders, namely, Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) and Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) reported huge operating losses, amounting to almost KRW8.5 trillion (USD7.4 billion, 0.5 percent of GDP). The financial positions of the three big shipbuilders declined sharply with interest coverage ratios below one in 2015/2016.

The combined self-rescue programs of the three shipbuilders, coupled with two rounds of external rescue packages for DSME proved successful. The financial indicators for these three shipbuilders, such as return on asset ratio (ROA) and debt to equity ratio (D/E), improved significantly in 2017, compared to 2015 (Table A2.2). In H1 2018, Korean shipbuilders received new orders equivalent to 4.96 million CGT, accounting for 40.0 percent of global orders, thereby reclaiming its global top rank, while new orders in H1 2017 was 3.21 million CGT (28.0 percent of global orders). This is the first time in the past three years that Korean shipbuilders have overtaken their Chinese competitors in terms of new orders received.

43,8,"8. Competitiveness of Korean shipbuilding. The productivity of Korean shipbuilders, measured by production (in CGT terms) per employee, started to decline after 2014, while that of Japan, was at a higher level (Figure A2.7). China’s productivity was low in 2013 compared to Japan and Korea, but is expected to have increased on account of cheaper labor costs and gradual technological advances made. Labor costs, which account for about 20.0 percent of the total shipbuilding production costs, are considered as one of decisive factor in receiving new orders. This was shown by the fact that Chinese shipbuilders defeated HHI in getting orders of container ships and Singapore’s shipbuilder (Sembcorp Marine, second largest offshore plant company that has no experience in large-scale projects) overcame SHI and DSME in winning the offshore plant orders on account of lower labor costs in August 201735.",FALSE,normal

The upcoming regulation requires shipping companies to lower Sulphur levels in fuel from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent37. The shipping companies need to achieve this requirement, either by using low- Sulphur fuel, installing sulphuric acid reduction devices, or switching to vessels consuming cleaner fuels like LNG.

45,5,"1. Portfolio investment flows have become a dominant force in driving Korea’s financial account dynamics post-GFC. This was especially so in 2009-2010 when portfolio investments recorded net inflows of about USD47 billion per annum, thereby guiding the financial account balance into surplus, and then in 2015 through early 2018 when the same investments reverted to net outflows of about USD58 billion per annum, in turn bringing the financial account into deficits (Figure A3.1). Given their large size, portfolio flows have largely determined the direction of the financial account balance for most of the period since 2009.",FALSE,normal
45,6,"2. The period immediately after the GFC was largely characterized by non-resident portfolio investment inflows (liabilities) (Figure A3.1). This trend likely reflected the global search for yield among investors as the adoption of unconventional monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve depressed interest rates there. Meanwhile, even as Korea was attracting non-resident portfolio inflows, residents’ overseas portfolio investments (assets) also started to increase more rapidly starting in the latter half of 2012―led by growing assets of Korea’s pension funds and insurance and asset management companies (see Box A3. Resident and Non-resident Portfolio Investments―A detailed look), eventually eclipsing foreign inflows starting in the latter half of 2014. Structural forces may be at play; Korea’s strong current account surplus (which surged more than four-fold in the two years after 2011) and the economy’s high saving rate under an aging population may have spurred such residents’ overseas portfolio investments (Figure A3.2).",FALSE,normal

In addition, a pick-up in Korea’s equity market also tends to encourage resident outflows somewhat which seems counter-intuitive, but may be reflective of increased earnings of Korean corporates, which in turn also increases the likelihood of greater overseas investments.

48,6,"A look at stock data suggests that both prefer equity over debt securities, although residents have pared down their equity holdings from 73 percent of the total in 2010 to about 60 percent as of June 2018, while non-residents have marginally increased their equity investments by about 4 percentage points to 69 percent in the same period. The remainder is held mostly in long-term debt securities. However, once we account for the BOK’s securities holdings from its reserve assets, then residents’ portfolio investments get tilted towards debt securities, accounting for 63 percent of the total as at June 2018 (Figure A3.2). An important point to note is that although Korea saw more resident portfolio investments overseas in 2010 – Q2 2018 than non-resident portfolio investment inflows, the stocks of portfolio investments continue to show a net liability position, if reserve assets are excluded.",FALSE,normal
48,7,"Resident and non-resident portfolio investment holdings also differ by asset type (Figure A3.3). For overseas portfolio investments by residents, Korea’s general government takes up over half of the equity investments and its share in total equity investments has risen sharply since 2010.42 This is driven by the National Pension Service (NPS) which has increased its overseas equity allocation in order to diversity its holdings.43 When investing overseas, the NPS invests more in equities than debt. On the whole, however, the bulk of its assets are still invested in domestic debt.44",FALSE,normal
48,8,"Likewise, Korea’s other financial corporations such as securities and insurance companies have markedly increased their investments in overseas debt securities― from 4 percent in 2010 to 23 percent as of June 2018―even as the BOK continues to dominate residents’ investments in foreign debt markets. According to the IMF’s latest Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), the U.S. is the primary destination for residents’ foreign portfolio",FALSE,normal

48,13,"42 General government refers to central and local governments and social security institutions. 43 For example, the NPS increased its overseas equity allocation to USD110 billion as of July 2018 – equivalent to 19.2 percent of the fund’s value – from USD42 billion or 10.4 percent of its value as of end-2013, according to a press release. 44 As of July 2018, 46.7 percent of the NPS’ assets are in domestic debt, and less than 4 percent allocated to global fixed income.",FALSE,normal

49,5,"On the liability side, foreign investments in Korea’s equity market largely go into non-financial corporations while foreign investor presence in the local debt markets is more varied.

About 40 percent of the foreign investments also originate from the U.S., with the remainder spread across Luxembourg, the U.K., Singapore and Japan, to name a few.",FALSE,normal
