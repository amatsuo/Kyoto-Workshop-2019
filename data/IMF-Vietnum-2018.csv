Reforms continued, including in the banking sector, privatizations and cuts in red tape. The momentum is expected to continue, aided by reforms, higher potential output, and the global recovery. However, economic distortions and capacity constraints remain, as do external and domestic risks and longer-term challenges. The strong economy provides an opportunity for additional reforms to boost investment, ensure durable growth and resilient balance sheets, and reduce the external surplus.",FALSE,normal
6,4,"Fiscal policy. Much-needed fiscal consolidation began in 2016–17. The public finances remain sustainable over the medium term, aided by privatization. But aging and other fiscal risks require more ambitious deficit reduction and a lower debt threshold than the statutory ceiling. Priority should be given to broadening tax bases and cutting current spending to make more room for public investment to meet large development needs.",FALSE,normal
6,5,"Monetary policy. Real money demand is rising due to ongoing de-dollarization and financial deepening. But monetary conditions remain accommodative and credit growth should be lowered more quickly to sustain macroeconomic stability. Greater two-way exchange rate flexibility within the current band should be allowed to help absorb external shocks including from volatile capital flows, facilitate real appreciation and lower the external surplus. Reserve accumulation should be more gradual, with fully sterilized interventions. Conditions are right for a phased shift to inflation targeting.",FALSE,normal
6,6,"Financial sector. Performance improved in 2017. But bank balance sheets, supervision, and risk management need to be further strengthened to improve the efficiency of financial intermediation. The government should recapitalize state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) swiftly and relax private-sector investment and foreign-ownership limits. Strong credit and asset price growth may be building up new risks in the financial system. It is critical to improve data quality and develop a macroprudential framework to proactively manage risks.",FALSE,normal
6,7,"Structural reform drive. Ongoing reforms to reduce the economic footprint of the state, level the playing field and promote private-sector-led growth are on the right track and should be accelerated if Vietnam is to meet the challenges of digitalization, climate change and aging.

9,4,"CONTEXT 1. A long track record of strong inclusive growth. Vietnam’s economy is one of the most dynamic in East Asia, with growth averaging 6½ percent a year during 2000–16. This reflects the cumulative benefits of outward and market-oriented reforms launched since 1986, resulting in a boom in the scale and sophistication of exports, and generally stable and accommodative macroeconomic conditions. Vietnam’s twin transition—from plan to market and from farms to modern manufacturing and services—is a multi-decade transformation that has been boosting productivity and living standards across all income levels (text Figure).",FALSE,normal
9,5,"2. A commitment to macroeconomic stability and private sector-led growth. The government views macroeconomic stability as a foundation for sustained private sector-led growth (Appendix I). Its economic agenda focuses on public debt sustainability and building buffers while addressing widespread investment needs and strengthening the banking sector. It is cognizant of the need to make macroeconomic frameworks more flexible to manage near-term risks and longer-term challenges from climate change, demographics and automation. And it is stepping up market-oriented reforms to reduce the economic role of the state, boost business conditions and improve the quality of growth and innovation.",FALSE,normal
9,6,"3. A large and multi-faceted reform agenda remains. While these achievements are substantial, sustaining and accelerating the pace of real convergence requires tackling a range of remaining distortions and capacity constraints. An important priority is to tackle barriers that constrain domestic investment and productivity in non-FDI firms and raise the external surplus. This requires, among other things, addressing remaining legacy issues in the banking system and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and leveling the playing field for access to land and credit. Faster convergence will also require quickening the pace of reforms, but without sacrificing the consensus-building approach to policy reforms garnering broad national ownership.",FALSE,normal

10,4,"2017: A BUMPER YEAR 4. 2017 was an exceptionally good year. Growth was broad-based and accelerated to 6.8 percent while inflation remained below the 4 percent target (Figure 1 and text Figures). Private consumption continued to be driven by rural-to-urban migration, rising incomes, and a growing middle class. It was also facilitated by accommodative financial conditions, stronger bank balance sheets, and the improving business climate. The current account surplus increased as the global recovery and a REER depreciation due to a weaker dollar aided strong inflows from exports, tourism, and remittances. Vietnam also received record FDI and other capital inflows, aided by solid growth, the improving business environment, accelerating domestic business formation, and the low global interest rates (Figure 2). The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) maintained the Dong within a tight range to the dollar and accumulated US$12½ billion of international reserves in 2017 (equivalent to 5.7 percent of GDP), bolstering low reserve buffers. Despite administered price increases, inflation was subdued, reflecting low food prices and a stable exchange rate.",FALSE,normal
10,5,"5. The external position was substantially stronger than warranted by fundamentals. The current account (CA) surplus reached 2½ percent of GDP in 2017 (Figure 2, Tables 1–2), resulting in a CA gap of 5.2 percent of GDP (Appendix II). The external position is thus substantially stronger than warranted by fundamentals and appropriate policy settings. The CA gap translates into an REER undervaluation of 7 percent (text Figure). The external surplus reflects the economy’s dualism: the surpluses were mainly generated in the booming FDI sector whereas the non-FDI sector continued to run a large deficit (text Figure).

While revenue exceeded budget targets, VAT collections fell short as anticipated reforms were delayed. Lower administrative expenditures and higher fees in health and education kept current spending in check. Nevertheless, the wage bill—approximately 9½ percent of GDP—remains high (text Figures). Public investment exceeded budget targets due to spending carried over from previous years (about ½ percent of GDP) and accelerated disbursement of project funding.

Credit outstanding reached 130 percent of GDP in 2017, resulting in a sizeable credit gap (text Figure) which maybe contributing to asset market valuations which are higher than fundamentals (Selected Issues Paper: Credit Growth and Asset Market Valuations). External inflows were strong during the year, including from equitization, with the SBV building reserves without full sterilization. This led to overnight interbank rates sliding well below the policy (repo) rate. Nevertheless, inflation remained low due to rising monetary-cum-financial deepening associated with a growing urban middle-class and de-dollarization, lower food prices and a stable exchange rate. Inflation is set to gradually increase to the 4 percent target over the medium-term as import prices strengthen.",FALSE,normal
17,8,"15. A tighter monetary policy is warranted. The policy stance should be tightened to drain excess liquidity, reduce credit gaps, and continue to keep inflation contained. Credit growth targets should be lowered further and the interbank and overnight rates should be brought closer to the policy rate. The lower credit target of 17 percent set for 2018 should help tighten monetary conditions but a more ambitious reduction to no more than 14 percent (Selected Issues Paper: Credit Growth and Asset Market Valuations) is needed compared to the baseline (Table 5). Greater two-way exchange rate flexibility within the current ± 3 percent band should be allowed. Reserve accumulation should continue but at a more gradual pace and interventions should be accompanied by active liquidity management.",FALSE,normal

18,4,"16. The monetary policy framework needs to be modernized. Vietnam would benefit from adopting a modern monetary framework using inflation as the nominal anchor, accompanied by greater exchange rate flexibility and improved monetary transmission. Credit targets should begin to be phased out to achieve more market-based capital allocation and improve banks’ risk management. Macroprudential tools should be developed to deal with financial stability risks (see next Section). Cross-country evidence suggests that a gradual, opportunistic but planned transition initiated in times of economic strength can be orderly and effective. The tools, institutions, and expertise can be developed over time, with greater exchange rate and interest rate flexibility catalyzing institutional and financial market development by sharpening incentives to manage risk. For such a framework to succeed, the central bank must be operationally independent, technically capable, and effective in communicating its monetary policy. Financial literacy of policymakers, the public and investors is crucial. Such transitions are best initiated in times of economic strength and financial stability to maximize buy-in and minimize reversals.",FALSE,normal

Monetary policy maintained macroeconomic stability in the face of large capital inflows, including equitization receipts, which posed challenges for liquidity management. The SBV succeeded in maintaining credit growth below target although growth was strong. Rising money demand, financial deepening and de-dollarization helped control inflation. The SBV intends to adhere to the 2018 credit growth target, while reassessing the target over the course of the year. They shared staff’s views about the need to transition gradually to a modernized framework using inflation as the nominal anchor and greater exchange rate flexibility. The SBV will continue to strengthen its capacity, and will sequence measures depending on economic conditions and capacity development across a range of institutions.

Numerous administrative measures were scrapped in 2017 to level the playing field; and, business formation has risen to record levels. The CPTPP, EU-FTA, and commitments under other FTAs, should further boost modernization and reforms. The legal framework for equitization, divestment and reform of SOEs is being revamped with the creation of an independent State Capital Management Committee (SCMC) overseeing all large SOEs to improve accountability and efficiency, while leaving management and regulation with line ministries and regulatory bodies.

25,7,"STAFF APPRAISAL 27. Vietnam’s dynamic, highly open economy continues to perform well. The solid performance is aided by macroeconomic and financial stability, stepped up economic reforms, and inflows of foreign direct investment which are enabling structural transformation and are raising potential growth. The strong economic momentum is expected to continue. But financial buffers are still thin, macroeconomic policy frameworks remain inflexible, complicating the management of shocks, and the external position is substantially stronger than warranted by fundamentals. The strong economy provides an opportunity for more ambitious reforms to level the playing field by tackling remaining distortions and capacity constraints, increasing investment and reducing the external surplus.",FALSE,normal
25,8,"28. Fiscal policy should emphasize high-quality consolidation to meet large development needs and ensure that Vietnam has fiscal space to meet longer-term challenges. A slightly more ambitious consolidation than currently planned, and a lower debt ceiling than the current statutory limit, will be needed to create additional fiscal room before aging sets in the mid-2030s and provision for contingencies. Stronger consolidation could boost medium-term growth if it relied on high-quality structural fiscal measures and measures to boost private investment. Reforms should focus on broadening tax bases; reducing administrative and wage-related spending; protecting social spending through well designed social security and civil service reforms; and, protecting and improving the quality of public investment. Comprehensive and timely fiscal accounts based on GFSM 2014 and improved budget planning and execution should help facilitate consolidation.",FALSE,normal
25,9,"29. To sustain macroeconomic stability, monetary policy should be tightened by further lowering credit growth to bring it in line with ongoing improvements in financial deepening. Greater two-way exchange rate flexibility within the current band should be allowed to reduce speculative inflows, absorb shocks and help bring down the external surplus. Reserve accumulation should continue but more gradually, with fully sterilized interventions. The modernization of the monetary framework should start, gradually easing away from credit targets to begin a phased shift to inflation targeting and greater exchange rate flexibility.",FALSE,normal

26,4,"30. Financial sector balance sheets, supervision and risk management need to be further strengthened. A stronger financial sector can help improve the efficiency of financial intermediation to service the domestic economy and investment. Strong credit and asset price growth may be contributing to the build-up of risks in the financial system. SOCBs should be capitalized swiftly with government funds, and by raising private sector and foreign ownership limits. It is critical to develop a macroprudential framework and improve data quality on credit aggregates and balance sheet exposures to monitor and proactively manage risks, and ensure that sufficiently robust liquidity and crisis management frameworks are in place to provide legal and operational clarity regarding early intervention and communication to mitigate emerging financial sector risks.",FALSE,normal

Priority areas include: high-quality infrastructure investments; further reductions in regulatory barriers and transitioning to international standards for regulatory excellence, transparency and data quality to aid investment; reforms to tertiary education; efforts to reduce the concentration of land ownership in state hands; and continued reforms in state-owned enterprises.

Productivity in this sector is low (20 percent of that of the FDI sector), and exports are dominated by agricultural commodities and oil.

Saving has remained at about 30 percent of GDP, which is high relative to peers, reflecting ineffective financial intermediation of high profits in the FDI sector into productive investment opportunities in the domestic economy because of foreign ownership limits and weaknesses in the banking system.",FALSE,normal

47,4,"Appendix IV. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis Vietnam’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt has risen by 10 percentage points of GDP in the last five years, to 58.5 percent of GDP in 2017. The authorities are planning fiscal consolidation, but concrete measures are not yet fully identified. Under staff’s baseline projections, which incorporate less consolidation than the authorities’ plan, PPG debt would remain about constant until 2023. Compared to the 2017 analysis, the projected debt trajectory is more benign, primarily due to the greater planned use of non-debt creating equitization revenues for budget financing, a lower 2017 deficit, lower interest payments due to lower financing needs in 2016 and 2017, and lower interest rates. Notwithstanding, staff continues to assess the debt sustainability risk as low to moderate, reflecting uncertainty about fiscal consolidation measures and equitization revenues and risks from potential contingent liabilities related to banks and SOEs.",FALSE,normal
47,5,Background. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework for market access countries is used to assess Vietnam’s debt sustainability and other risks related to its funding and debt structure. The framework uses a risk-based approach and expands upon the basic DSA to include (i) an assessment of the realism of baseline assumptions and the projected fiscal adjustment; (ii) an analysis of risks associated with the debt profile; (iii) macro-fiscal risks; (iv) a stochastic debt projection taking into account past macro-fiscal volatility; and (v) a standardized summary of risks in a heat map. This DSA also examines the implications of implementation risks by considering a no-adjustment scenario.,FALSE,normal
47,6,"Coverage. The DSA is performed on the public and publicly guaranteed debt and external debt. In addition to the central government, the analysis covers state owned enterprises (SOEs) and specialized financial institutions (SFIs), limited to the debt guaranteed by the government. Local government debt is included in the public debt.",FALSE,normal
47,7,"Macro-fiscal assumptions. Using the baseline scenario, growth slightly declines from 6.8 percent in 2017 to a projected 6.6 percent in 2018, and stabilizes at potential—6.5 percent—in the medium term. In the baseline, staff projects a primary fiscal deficit of 2.6 percent in 2018, which is assumed to remain constant over the medium-term.",FALSE,normal
47,8,Choice of framework. Vietnam’s recent surge of public debt and its relatively high debt level call for using the more detailed version (higher scrutiny) of the new DSA framework. This analysis gives a more in-depth assessment of specific risks to debt sustainability.,FALSE,normal
47,9,"Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast errors for real GDP growth, primary balance and inflation during 2008–16 are small, around -0.4 percent, showing no evidence of systematic projection bias that could undermine the assessment.",FALSE,normal
47,10,"Cross-country experience suggests that the baseline fiscal adjustment is feasible. The maximum three-year adjustment in the cyclically adjusted primary balance (CAPB) over the projected period is 1 percent, with fiscal consolidation assumed to be achieved mainly through expenditure reduction, absent of structural revenue enhancing measures.",FALSE,normal
47,11,"Public debt sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, PPG debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline by 0.6 percentage points in 2018, with privatization receipts partially compensating for the primary deficit.

48,5,"The constant primary balance scenario tracks the baseline scenario closely, given little change in the projected deficits. The historical scenario—in which real GDP growth, the primary balance and real interest rates are set at their historical average—leads to a level of PPG debt similar to the constant primary balance scenario, but foresees temporarily higher financing needs. Macro-fiscal stress tests suggest that Vietnam is more vulnerable to real interest rate and primary balance shocks but these shocks would not carry the debt-to GDP ratio over the 70 percent threshold. A real interest rate shock, in which the effective interest rate is increased by 55 basis points in 2020 to 185 basis points in 2023, would raise PPG debt to 60 percent of GDP. A combined macro-fiscal shock in 2018 would increase PPG debt to 66 percent of GDP by 2023.",FALSE,normal
48,6,"Probability distributions from a dynamic simulation of debt sustainability under an array of macroeconomic shocks show that in a negative-case scenario, PPG debt could reach about 73 percent of GDP with 10 percent likelihood by 2023, while a combination of positive shocks would help reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 50 percent with a 25 percent probability. While the medium- term outlook is relatively positive, the current DSA does not include potentially large contingent liabilities from potentially high levels of non-guaranteed SOE debt and the costs of recapitalizing SOCBs and the SCIC. It only takes into account the already-determined remaining amounts for recapitalizing Agribank (0.2 percent of GDP), assumed to be finalized by end-2019. Lack of more specific information makes the assessment of the underlying risks difficult at this time.",FALSE,normal

In particular, short-term external private debt grew by 70 percent to reach US$22 billion. About half of the increase went towards the purchase of SABECO’s shares, a SOE equitized in December 2017.",FALSE,normal
48,9,"Under the baseline, external debt would increase to 50.2 percent of GDP in 2018 and would reach 54 percent of GDP by 2023 as gross external financing needs rises, in line with the projected erosion of the current account surplus. Vietnam’s external debt is vulnerable to real depreciation and current- account shocks while growth and interest rate shocks have only limited impact on the external debt dynamics.",FALSE,normal

56,10,"Vietnam’s dynamic, highly open economy had a bumper year in 2017. Growth was broad-based and accelerated to 6.8 percent while inflation remained below the 4 percent target reflecting low food prices and a stable exchange rate. Private consumption continued to be driven by rural-to- urban migration, rising incomes, and a growing middle class. It was also facilitated by accommodative financial conditions, stronger bank balance sheets, and an improving business climate as reforms continued in the banking sector, privatizations and cuts in red tape. The current account surplus increased as the global recovery and real effective depreciation due to a weaker dollar helped strong inflows from exports, tourism, and remittances. Vietnam also received record FDI and other capital inflows, aided by solid growth, accelerating domestic business formation, and the low global interest rates. The central bank maintained the Dong within a tight range to the dollar and accumulated US$12½ billion of international reserves in 2017, bolstering low reserve buffers.",FALSE,normal

Growth is projected at 6.6 percent in 2018, despite a mild tightening in credit growth targets and a neutral fiscal stance. Inflation is forecast to rise to just under the 4 percent target, led by higher oil prices and gradual increases in administered prices. On current trends and if reforms continue at their current pace, 6½ percent annual growth remains feasible beyond 2018.

58,5,"To sustain macroeconomic stability, monetary policy should be tightened by further lowering credit growth to bring it in line with ongoing improvements in financial deepening. Greater two- way exchange rate flexibility within the current band should be allowed to reduce speculative inflows, absorb shocks and help bring down the external surplus. Reserve accumulation should continue but more gradually, with fully sterilized interventions. The modernization of the monetary framework should start, gradually easing away from credit targets to begin a phased shift to inflation targeting and greater exchange rate flexibility.",FALSE,normal

A stronger financial sector can help improve the efficiency of financial intermediation to service the domestic economy and investment. Strong credit and asset price growth may be contributing to the build-up of risks in the financial system. SOCBs should be capitalized swiftly with government funds, and by raising private sector and foreign ownership limits.
